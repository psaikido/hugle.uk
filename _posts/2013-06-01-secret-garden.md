#### June 2013
Most of the summer gigs were at festivals. The standout moment was at the Secret Garden Party, wandering along a magical, lakeside path, and bumping into two girls doing mime. They started to clean me down with feather dusters. I did magic for them and they mimed back in response. Two mirrors reflecting back off each other, delightful.
