Amazing day with the grand old man of British magic. What a thrill it was. There were supposed to be 10 students but for unknown reasons 8 didn't show up. Just the 3 of us then! Will expand on this at some point, but basically I didn't stop grinning for days, it was very special and I learned an enormous amount from a very funny and talented guy. Oh, and Debbie McGee was there briefly when I arrived, long enough to offer drinks and snacks, what more could you want?
