The talk of 'triggers' is now used in at least two ways. The way it is used in political discourse and that of mental health services. I say 'political discourse' but I really mean 'right wing propaganda' because it is a term of abuse used against political enemies, a way of ridiculing the sensitivies of the 'woke'. It is seen in the outpourings of fascist sentiments spilling out in conservative circles. It is a reaction against a culture that first grew in the psychiatric world.  

You see, I have [PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder). I was diagnosed by the guy that first looked after [Terry Waite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Waite) when he was released from his awful prison experiences. That guy was [Gordon Turnbull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Turnbull), the early theorist of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He told me my case was both chronic and acute. Originally the term used was about having a 'flashback'. Think Vietnam Vet thinking he's back in the jungle, fighting for his life because he's heard a car backfire many years after coming home. It's become a trope.

For me there are situations that 'trigger' something similar. For a while after a fall in 1991 when a [circus](/pages/pix/circus.html) stunt went wrong, seeing people fall on TV, or certain patterns of yellow and red that reminded me of the Snapdragon Circus tent I used to work in as a juggler, actor and musician, would send me into a seething hot mess of rigid panic. My body would convulse and I would feel that I was endlessly falling into an immense abyss of dark terror. Intense!  

Now when I see that word 'trigger' used as an insult as in "Your triggers are your responsibility. Don't expect the world to tip-toe around you", a meme seen recently on social media, something dreamed up by an acolyte of some right wing think tank perhaps, it triggers me in a different way again. It triggers the way I feel reading [Primo Levi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_Levi) and his lifelong effort to understand the mentality of his persecutors in the concentration camps of the Second World War.  

I'm reminded of the tribulations of my dad during that war. Of that whole generation and the scars that fascism left behind. And now here it is again. The 'othering' of hated out groups. The deliberate cruelty, the spectacular hypocrisy, the shameless twisting of meanings into their reverse. For them the abomination is not slavery, it is the protests of those opposing racism. It is not the brutality of that racism it is seeing black faces in adverts. It is not the pompous stupidity of machismo and sexism but the attempts to treat each other in kinder and more sensitive ways. And thus the fever returns. The cult of the powerful leader, the rise of 'patriotism' and flag waving. The nationalists attempt to annihilate all that makes them afraid, ie. the modern world. The attempt to get back to an earlier golden age when people knew their place. Heirarchies to be maintained at all and any cost. Disaster cannot be averted by attacking anyone, by 'othering' those seen as an enemy.  

Here I must confess that I too feel a deep disgust and 'other' the right wingers. I can't help it! At the same time I feel a vast, heart-broken and tearful pain when contemplating this political conflict at the very moment that we teeter on the brink of a disaster too vast and too final to countenance. The extinctions of entire species, the displacements of countless millions, the untold sufferings of a future that need not be if we could only make decisions based on long term and universal thinking. The 'council of all beings' will not look kindly on us I fear, if we don't stop squabbling, if we don't stop putting our own interests above everything else. My patriotism is to the entire planet and to everything that lives here.
