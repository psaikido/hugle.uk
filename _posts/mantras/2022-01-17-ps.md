Session #5. About 2/3rds of the way through the initial pass. It looks like it will need at least 3 passes. I'm going to guess that we'll have a count of about 25 sessions by the end.  

The central bar of the 'dzra' ཛྲ disintegrated the moment I went near it! There are pockets of unstable powder and also lumps of much harder and whiter crystalline stuff to negotiate. I was worried that this much bigger stone would be too heavy to work with in the way I've learned but it's proving just about do-able. 

The ME situation is that there is usually a 'post exertional malaise' after activity. Today's recovery from the session was unusually long - zonked for around 2 hours. Might have to shorten the sessions to sustain the work.

Yesterday's session #4. The second letter 'ah' has the same radical as the 'om' before it but has a subscript vowel mark too. Not sure why it needs that as radicals have an integral 'ah' sound. More strange is it has two dots after it. I have asked about them and apparently it's something to do with transcribing from Sanskrit! I used to think they were a kind of repeat mark but not so. I've put some time into learning the alphabet but can't claim to read or speak Tibetan. I could get by in Ladakhi for a summer, but that was long ago now.
