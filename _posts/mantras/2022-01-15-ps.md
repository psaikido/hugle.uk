Session #3 - first time of doing one of these decorative motifs. I've often admired them in printed texts. Also new to me are the punctuation 'tsek' dots between letters. Whatever the rules are about whether a letter gets a tsek or not elludes me! We'll have a ༔ repeat mark at the end too :) I have done those ones before.
