Started the second pass which is to define the main parts of the letters, leaving the fine detail for now, and getting down to near the final depth. Making the base all the same depth and flat is nearly as hard as the letters themselves. It is very pleasing to see the characters get near their final shapes and stand out this way, especially the shadows they cast.
