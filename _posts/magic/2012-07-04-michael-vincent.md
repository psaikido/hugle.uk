Really inspiring lecture full of [Elegant Deceptions](http://michaelvincent.co.uk/) from the mercurial Mr Vincent at the Magical Society last night. His links with the greats of the past was very exciting and I felt that the evening linked me to the great tradition. This is the way I have felt about magic for always and it was comforting and exciting at the same time.
