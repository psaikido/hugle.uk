Hughie aka:  Hugh, Hubles, Hughie McGinty, Cháng Kè, Sonam Wangchuk, Hugle,

(there's more..)  


Born in 1964 in Merseyside to a third generation Irish immigrant Catholic
family, Hughie writes and flies kites. In his youth he was a performer, playing
in bands, doing juggling, acting, magic and stunts. He worked in New Circus as
it was then called. He busked and performed in Europe and the UK for around ten
years in the late 80s to early 90s. He taught guitar on and off, for many
years, he started playing when he was nine. He has a distinction at Grade 7 in
Classical Guitar.

A serious fall while performing a stunt during a rehearsal for Snapdragon
Circus in 1991, left him with PTSD. The illness gradually morphed into [ME/CFS](https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/filebase/education/top_resources/ER-and-Urgent-Care-Considerations-for-MECFS-1.19.22-005.pdfhttps://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/filebase/education/top_resources/ER-and-Urgent-Care-Considerations-for-MECFS-1.19.22-005.pdf)
which was eventually diagnosed in 2001. 

After the accident, Hughie went into IT. He has a
[portfolio](/gallery/portfolio/) of many websites and considered himself
a 'full-stack web developer' until the illness stopped him working
professionally in 2018. The main software for the Western Chan Fellowship is
built and maintained by him (also [this site](#technicals-about-this-site)). 

His deep love of Buddhism started shortly after the accident. He has attended
over 40 week long zen intensive meditation retreats, mostly with the [Western
Chan Fellowship](https://westernchanfellowship.org). He was a senior student of
the late, great [John
Crook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crook_(ethologist)). He went on
pilgrimage to Ladakh and the main Buddhist sites in India and Nepal. This trip
is written up in [Pilgrimage](/prose/pilgrimage/010-leaving/). He has also done two pilgrimages in
China, visiting many of the original Chan temples and important locations. He
ran a meditation group for twenty years and has undergone a three month silent
retreat. He made an album of Buddhist inspired music, called
[Mantrasphere](/mantrasphere/). He has carved many [mantra
stones](/gallery/stones/), learning the ancient craft at Lamayuru Gompa
in Ladakh. 

He has written two volumes of poetry, [Yarn](/yarn/) and [Sunshine &
Shadow](/sun/). He is a 'Double Triple Master' at Revolution Club38, a facebook
group of fanatical quad-line kite fliers. He lives in the South West of the UK.
