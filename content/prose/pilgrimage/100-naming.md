###### Kunchok Namdrol and me – Lamayuru 2005.

A few minutes before the picture above was taken, Kunchok Namdrol had
spontaneously given me a Dharma name!

Each morning there was a few
hours of chanting and ritual in their Dharma hall. It was the time of renewal.
The sutras get chanted in unison, a sand mandala is made and they bring out all
the instruments. There are symbols and massive horns, human thigh-bone
trumpets, all sorts of amazing things. Since I couldn’t join in I just sat in
meditation. Little boy monks, "getsul", ran amongst the rows of monks pouring
the hideous yak butter salty tea. It is an acquired taste! I would take
periodic breaks from zazen, sitting meditation, to have some tea and each time
I opened my eyes Kunchok Namdrol was always taking me in with those brown eyes
of his. I was just in his field of vision rather than him observing me, it
didn’t feel like I was being studied or anything. 

These sessions went on every morning for about two weeks. Just after one of
them we were all milling around, looking out over the mountains and having a
stretch from being sat still so long. He turns to me and announces that I am
"Wangchuk". I ask him if he’s just named me and he beams a grin at me and
proudly says that he has. Now, my Ladakhi was only at the most basic level so
we couldn’t discuss it very much. I asked him what it meant but he didn’t know
the English. It was a while before I could find someone to tell me. They said
it means "mighty"! This could have been a bit of a joke since the ME symptoms I
had been plagued with for ages were really raging back then and I was obviously
very weak, if not simply from so many gut infections.

The next day we went through the same thing and once again hanging out after
the session, looking out over the Zanskar mountain range I asked him how he
knew my name was "Wangchuk"? He looked out with a thousand-mile-gaze for a long
time and eventually replied "Sonam Wangchuk". I asked if he had just named me
again to which he again proudly replied that he had! "Sonam" means "merit" so
that’s my Dharma name - "Sonam Wangchuk - Mighty Merit"!
