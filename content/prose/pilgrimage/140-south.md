The season was nearly over and everyone visiting Ladakh was leaving
before the snows blocked the roads. I got a ticket for the second to
last bus to Manali. The road goes some three hundred miles to
Manali, over the Himalayas and crosses the Rhotang Pass. It is one
of the highest and most dangerous roads in the world! 

The travellers gathered in the early hours of the morning but the bus driver
did not appear. We listened to a very sleepy muezzin give the call to prayer
really badly, which made everyone laugh. After discussions someone claimed to
know where the driver lived and they went off to see what was happening. At
long last they returned, the driver had simply been asleep, and off we went. 

At one toilet stop I did some magic for the locals and got an odd reaction. The
Indian family’s eyes went like saucers and they looked really frightened. I
realised that they might be thinking the effects were actually supernatural.
For a delicious few minutes I toyed with the idea of building on the incredible
status they had assumed for me but quickly decided that it was the road to
darkness. I let them in on a few secrets to diffuse their tension and
eventually got them laughing and messing about. Again, it was shocking to meet
this belief in things supernatural in such a direct and personal way.

We reach the Rhotang pass without too much trouble. The road is pretty terrible
in parts. Looking out of the window I see what looks like straight down,
hundreds of metres. We see the remains of trucks and buses smashed to
smithereens below us. Everyone tightens up. Folks at the back of the bus,
behind the rear axle, are being thrown around. One guy gets a bad hit to the
head from the roof!

A vast plain opens out before us with a little smudge of dust being raised. As
we cover the miles the smudge gradually grows and after a while I see it is
actually a single person walking with hundreds of goats. When I realise what
I’m looking at my mind suddenly has a point of reference and reels at taking in
the scale of the place. It is awe-inspiring.

We bounce over the Himilayas all that day and then are left at a little group
of houses. The bus driver lets us in to a cafe sort of a place but there is
no-one there and nothing to eat. It is really late and dark and everyone is
tired and feeling beaten up by the journey. There’s nothing for it but to try
and get some rest. 

Everyone makes a nest as best they can and we all fall a sleep in basically a
big heap of strangers. At first light we are roused and are hustled back on to
the bus. It goes only a short way and leaves us on the side of a gorge where
the road bridge has fallen down. It takes a while to realise what is happening
which is that there are wires strung over the chasm. A furious torrent explodes
out of the high mountains and thunders away to our right. A new bridge is
partly constructed and its girders sit on wooden blocks. It is maybe ten metres
above the  waters. 

To my horror I spot people crossing it, one carrying a sheep on his back! They
climb on the wet girders high above the rushing waters. It makes me feel
queezy. We join a queue. At first I’m not sure what it is for but there’s
nothing else to do apart from attempt to climb it like those nutters up there.
Wires have been strung across the river and a group of three guys on either end
are pulling a metal cage across. A person and their bags is loaded in and then
hauled over.

When it is my turn I have a feeling of deep surrender as the anxiety reaches
its peak mid-stream. It seems that there has been some release of the past as I
symbolically "cross the Rubicon". 

When we have all got across we then wonder how our journey is going to
continue. We ask around and various negotiations take place which eventually
results in a few big taxi vans being hired. Later that day when we approach
Manali we pass a sign that says "Inconvenience regretted". Our van load became
hysterical with laughter at that one.

A foot note to that journey was that we met up with the folks who had come on
the last bus, the one after us. The driver had apparently kept falling asleep
at the wheel with the huge drops next to the collapsing road. The passengers
mutineed because the driver would not stop or let anyone else drive. They
counted to three and grabbed him out of the driver’s seat while someone pulled
the handbrake. An Australian volunteered to give it a go and managed to get
everyone to the downed bridge safely!

I really hope to return to Ladakh one day.
