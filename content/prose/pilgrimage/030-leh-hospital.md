Within a few days I start getting diarrhoea which doesn’t ease up.
Ngawang advises that I go to consult with a doctor who takes a few
minutes to decide that I should be admitted to the hospital and be
put on a drip since I’m so dehydrated. They take me to a room with
two beds. An Indian lady is lying on one with an oxygen mask on.
They hook me up to a saline drip whose stand has a missing wheel.
Around 9pm the lights go out and the lady’s oxygen machine turns
off. 

I wrestle the drip stand into the blackness of the toilet where
there is no paper and no flush. This happens some dozen or so times
over night. In the pre-dawn darkness I can see a little from a
street light that there is something wrong with the drip. I take it
over to the window to get a better look and see that my blood has
backed up into the tube, it is no longer delivering the hydration.

No one answers when I press the ‘nurse’ button – ah, the electric is
out. I stumble along a dark corridor trying to find someone. The
dizziness and weakness make me stumble and lurch. There is a light
and some voices. I call out but can hardly produce any sound. The
corridor seems to get longer the more I struggle up it. I dig in
deep and concentrate on not fainting before making it to the light.
It all seems very epic and life-and-death right then. At last I get
to the voices. One says "you shouldn’t be out of bed!", the other
says "your drip is blocked!" in an annoyed sort of a way. They sort
me out. 

When it gets light the electric comes back on but there is
some problem with the Indian lady's oxygen pump machine where its
electric socket has stopped working. There is one above my bed on
the other side of the room from her. They stretch the wire to it,
going right over me. It strains on its feeble little pins. I keep
saying "why don't you swap us over?" but no one listens. Eventually
one of the nurses says "why don't we swap them over?" and so they
do.

As the gaggle of doctors and nurses start to leave I see that
they haven't changed over our notes hanging on the end of our beds.
I have to wolf-whistle to get their attention to tell them about it. They
swap them over and leave. By the time I am discharged later that
morning they have put three litres of saline into me and I'm as weak
as a kitten.
