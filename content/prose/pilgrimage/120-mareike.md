A group of German Buddhists had come for teaching from their guru,
Lama Jorphel. I had been wondering about whether to join the
Vajrayana formally and accept a guru myself. We had met on a few
occasions and I had found him very dismissive, abrupt almost,
clearly not thinking much of me. Anyway, they all thought he was
marvellous. 

There had been several wonderful evenings with the
Germans and I found Mareike particularly engaging. She laughed so
prettily at my jokes and she kind of set my heart all a
pitter-patter! As our relationship got more intense there were
rumours going around the monastery about us, but we didn’t care. We
had a wonderful fortnight together. For some reason I was ejected
from the room in the big hotel I had been given and was "invited" to
move rooms at about twice the rent. I moved in with her after she
very generously invited me. 

A few days in to this new scenario their
guru came by. He had a little entourage with him and he was
apparently "doing the rounds" but I suspect that he was coming to
see if the rumours were true. He asked me right out "where are you
staying?" to which I replied "with Mareike". He said something like
"she is my student" with what I felt to be an implication of there
being something wrong with what we were up to. Looking him in the
eye with a bit of a "fuck you" about me I said "yes and she has been
very generous and kind to me when they tried to double my rent". 

He
suddenly changed completely, going all soft and kind. He tapped me
on the chest and said "good, good, you can be my student too if you
want to". That really took me by surprise. I was being tested I
think. I mulled it over for a few days and decided that his harsh
attitude when we first met had already poisoned the relationship.
Way too much the authoritarian for my ex-catholic, bohemian
sensibilities. 

After the evening meal one of the monks, a twenty
something "Jack the Lad" type got pretty aggressive. He must have
heard that the rumours about me and Mareike were true. As we came
out of the refectory he barged me with his shoulder in a way that
made everyone notice. The little getsul monks formed a circle around
us in a flash. He wiped his mouth with a serviette, screwed in to a
ball and with as much disrespect as he could muster, threw it at me.
It bounced off my chest harmlessly, but everyone looked at me to see
what I would do.

It was the most direct invitation to a fight that I
had had for a very long time. I had been meditating a great deal and
had been solidifying this "set up the mind state you want and defend
it" thing. One often sees Buddha rupas (statues) with one hand held
up with the palm outwards. It is the "Abaya mudra" and represents
fearlessness. This had come to symbolise for me the state where
one’s mind is reflecting everything without reacting, just like a
mirror. It occurred to me just then, looking at the mean, narrowed
eyes of my would-be jealous assailant to hold up my hand in the
mudra. As I did so I was thinking "your move" and all eyes turned
away from me and back to him. He acted like a deflating football,
visibly shrinking and turning bright red with embarrassment and
running off. Good job because he would’ve been able to take me
apart!

I made a present for her, a little mani stone that would not
be too heavy to take back with her. Our time came to an all-too-soon
end. It had been a very healing time for me, feeling that life
wasn’t yet over. My ex-wife’s affair had left a big, ragged,
bleeding scar and her affection had brought some sunshine back to a
very hurt and darkened heart. 

We waved goodbye and watched as the
jeep threw up dust as it left. A wrench. I wiped away a tear and the
monk next to me, Tsondup, asked why I was sad. I said "we were not
together for long but it was long enough to fall just a little bit
in love". Without a trace of irony he said "I’ve heard about this
love you Westerners speak of. What is it?" I said that surely they
had it here in Ladakh when people got together and he said that it
was all about arrangement over land and children and so forth, the
concept of romantic love was alien to him! Not to me though – even
as the jeep pulled away I could feel that terrible lurch inside as
the loss of sweet Mareike hit home.
