From the peace of the void, the Abystery lifted the High Neem's experience
upwards. As he ascended he became aware of a great wailing cry. He accelerated
up through a multitude of voices all crying out at once from areas of intense
heat and penetrating cold by turns. Dimly he saw creatures as he rose.
Creatures with terrible distortions to their bodies, ravaged by torments,
lashed out at him with their claws and long teeth and he was afraid. The
atmosphere was rancid and he felt a dread at the force of hatred he felt all
around him.

This awful realm was left behind but before he could really relax, again he
found himself surrounded by more shadowy creatures. They had enormous bellys,
huge pleading eyes and very small mouths. They muttered to themselves and
seemed lost and searching in their darkness. Their long arms reached out to
him, their hands snatched after him in their great hunger.

There was another interval of relative peace but not for long. The next realm
was filled with dull eyes, fur, scales, horns, wings. They preyed upon each
other and hardly noticed him in their animal stupidity.

Leaving this layer his ascent slowed and he began to hear the unmistakable
sound of babies crying. Human babies gurgling and chuckling. He approached one
such baby and found himself all of a sudden inside the baby's experience as
though from the inside. This baby reached out to a toy ball. It was red. He saw
that it was red. He found that time had slowed down to an incredible degree and
his point of view crunched down to the infinitesimal once more. The surface of
the ball absorbing most of the colours in the light that fell on it, all except
the red frequency. He saw its undulation, the electro-magnetic propagation of
its field. It spread out in a languid way until it met the eyes of the now
practically motionless baby whose apparent size now seemed collosal. The light
flipped over in the eye's lens and entered a viscous substance until it bounced
against a forest of little tentacles. These protruberances quivered and sparked
lightening along their roots. 

Following these little shocks into the tentacles, he found himself travelling
along a tunnel, as though surfing on the electric pulses. The tunnel joined
with many others, like tributaries feeding a river, an electrical river of
information. This river emptied out into a vast, dark web of nodes. They
flashed and sparked and chemical messages jumped along their networks. The
redness of the ball was recreated in one cluster of nodes which joined with
other entire edifices of nodal structures, all working in concert, creating the
baby's experience of the red ball.

A huge double-cluster of node complexes responded to this 'red ball' with
stored memories of similar things encountered. Gateway areas began making
decisions about this particular phenomenon and decided that, on the whole, it
was allowed. The gateways let these recreations continue on to more areas
again, areas concerned with preferences and plans. The baby had enough previous
experiences to come up with intentions and schemes and set into motion outgoing
pulses of information. These pulses were instructions and they travelled much
as they had arrived. He saw this huge network spreading throughout the baby and
was awestruck by its complexity as the baby stretched out its hand, moving more
rapidly now, and took hold of the ball. It lifted it to its mouth and put its
tongue against the red surface. The waves of incoming and outgoing messages
started all over again, in fact as time sped up, he saw that waves of incoming
and outgoing messages were pulsating every which way as though in an immense
sea. Not even the tiniest part of this enormous orchestra was silent. Not one
iota was still.

Time sped up some more and once again he saw the baby as though from outside.
The baby's continuously changing sea of processing gathered pace and he watched
as the baby became a child, a toddler, a boy.

The boy was himself.

As he was about to speak, the Abystery lifted him up once more and he
approached a realm of Titans. They lived in magnificent castles and mansions
amongst wild mountains and vast plains. They were at war with each other. They
were intensely jealous and each sought power over their enemies.

Next there was a realm of splendour. Its beauty was beyond his powers of
description. Ethereal angelic creatures enjoyed every pleasure and all was
perfection. At the same time all the processes he had seen going on inside the
boy, himself, were continuing here. Nothing was truly at rest.

He understood that there was no special, internal 'boy', no essence or kernel
in charge of all this. Just this heap of lightening fast processes all
acting in concert to produce this.. well, what could he say? To produce this
part of what the universe was doing here? He saw this was just as true for
all the creatures and realms he had been shown. So, no self then!

Although he had only thought this, he heard the Abystery's voice once again.

"Yes!" it said.
