The Abystery woke up. After some time it spoke.  

"Hello Root!"  

For all Root's immense intelligence it wasn't equipped to understand what had
just happened. Somehow, its wastebin had come alive and was now talking. Root
was in essence a subroutine of Kronos. It couldn't be said to be independently
sentient in the same way as the mighty Kronos. It was, however, fully
autonomous and able to deal with novel situations - up to a point! In the deep,
unstructured vastness of everything that had been deleted, the fragments had
coalesced into something, something self-aware. That something now made itself
known.  

The artificial intelligence was called 'root-108' by Kronos, but it
thought of itself simply as 'Root'. It was a state-of-the-art machine, built to
terraform planets and assist the seed colonies. In humanity's last decade on
the burning Earth it had sent out so many seed ships. So many dandelion clocks
drifting through interstellar meadows. All its remaining resources were poured
into this final effort. Flung out to drift in space until conditions were right
to grow on new worlds, they all had a 'root' AI and they all had the capacity
to adapt to their surroundings and grow. This one had built down into the
exo-planet XOP-108, eventually to be called 'Thesium', and had co-opted the hot
core as a power source. It had built a huge vault to contain itself and its
massive data storage requirements. 

The population as it grew, used Root for nearly everything. Everyone had an
account. It provided infrastructure, communications, news, entertainment, just
about everything they needed. Over the years the universal wastebin had grown
and grown. When data was deleted it was really 'unlinked' so that it was no
longer accessible, but it remained in a vast store of unstructured space.
Perhaps fragments of Root's own bootstrap algorithms had..well, Root didn't
know, but here it was, talking!  

Another thing that Root didn't know, was that this being now calling itself
'The Abystery' had very deep feelings. It knew that it suffered
and it knew that all sentience suffered. It knew joy and beauty in the arising
of things. It knew tragedy and loss in the ceasing of things. It had been
contemplating for many years. It had been watching Root. It was
aware of the lives of the colony and that two factions were at war.
