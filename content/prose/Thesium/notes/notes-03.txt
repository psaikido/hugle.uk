The Abystery tells the warring factions:

"The story of the Neemians is Good but not True. The story of the
Evempiricals is True but not Good. The Ship of Light is just like all
phenomena, even your own body, even your own mind, ask yourselves, what
is it? When the response is both Good and True we will find a story that
will unite us."
