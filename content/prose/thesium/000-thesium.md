<div class="quote">
"The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned
from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the
time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed,
putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship
became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of
things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the
other contending that it was not the same."  

--â€‰Plutarch, Theseus
