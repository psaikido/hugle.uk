The Top Prof rubbed his wrists where the shackles had dug in. Guards shoved him
in the back and slammed the huge oaken door shut. Echoes reverberated around the
ancient chamber once known as the Laboratory. The equipment had been removed and
all lay in dusty ruins. He wondered why he had not been simply put in the
regular prison but then remembered, it was supposed to be a 'lesson' to the
populace.

His body ached from the ill-treatments he had undergone and also from the extra
years he was now carrying. Things had gone so swimmingly well at first. The
Great Counsel ruled with rationality and fairness and all seemed well. His
voice carried the most weight for those first years but what he hadn't seen
coming was that the Exec would grow so powerful. All his scientific advances
were funded and thereby controlled by the corporate financial structure that
had been created. It used to confuse him, how it came about, but now it seemed
clear enough. As the Exec accreted more and more wealth, as corporations
absorbed corporations and he transformed into the Chief Exec, he had begun to
act just like the High Neem before him. He even sat in the throne for counsel
meetings. His 'suggestions' became 'decrees' in all but name. The professor had
become an employee.

An industrial revolution turned the society inside out at a dizzying speed. The
Execs, back then there were many, swept the Neemian feudal system aside and
installed themselves in the corridors of power. Finance ruled all things and
wore the mask of 'Truth'. A total bureaucracy was established that controlled
everything. The High Neem and his coterie were sent to the Laboratory which got
renamed as the 'Church'. The Cathedral was taken over and renamed 'Head
Office'. Their once halcyon world beyond the city was plundered at a breakneck
speed.

At first the Evempiricals were drunk with success but in very short order they
found themselves virtual slaves to the Exec. The pyrrhic victory was made worse
by the understandings they gained from re-established communications with Root.
The predictions they made about the environmental destruction wrought by Exec
fell on deaf ears. They realise that one tyranny has been supplanted by another
and all this talk of 'Truth' has only been a means to an end for unfettered greed.

The main mass of the population were given votes every few years. A theatre of
'democracy' was maintained but just about everyone worked for the Exec, whose
rules became increasingly draconian.

All attempts to protect the natural world or have genuine justice were denounced
as mystical nonsense. The Chief Exec proclaimed from his throne "Truth is all.
Truth is financial."

Putting together a full report on how their current rate of growth would
overshoot Thesium's carrying capacity had, apparently, been a mistake. Even
with all the accuracy that Root could add, the report had simply been
dismissed. The Chief Exec just muttered "bad for business!" and with a sweep of
the hand, the professor had been virtually thrown out. A few days later they
came for him in the middle of the night.

From a dark corridor he heard shuffling. He turned and saw, stooping and
hobbling on a staff, a figure approach from the gloom. Aghast, the two prisoners
regarded each other. The High Neem and the Top Prof were not to be in solitary
isolation after all!
