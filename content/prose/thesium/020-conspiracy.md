Colonel Nimes winked as he got up. "You two should have a lot to talk about"
he said. He strode away and left them at the little restaurant table, a bottle
of expensive red just opened. The two scientists had only just been introduced
but they had heard of each other.

"Tell me, Doug, how's the AI research getting on? Now the Colonel has started
the ball rolling, as it were, we can talk openly I'm sure."

"Well, er Maya is it? Well, erm, it's ok to tell you? Is it?"

"We're to swap our research and see if they can combine. You heard him didn't
you?"

"Yes, I suppose so. It's ingrained in the military research side of things to
not talk to, er, strangers."

"Look Doug, would it help if I started?"

"Erm, yes, yeah, I mean, yes, that would be good, I guess.." Doug trailed off.
He wasn't used to socialising, he hadn't been out of the lab for months, the
code he and his team had lived and breathed was the most advanced in history.
He wasn't used to all the soldiers standing stiffly about the place either.
Their hi-tech guns made him nervous. These guys never seemed to smile.

Maya leaned forward "My group's lunar base has a facility for making Von
Neumann machines. We have actual working prototypes already. They can rebuild
and reconfigure themselves. That makes them, practically speaking, immortal! Of
course, no one can breathe a word of this but look, the Colonel thinks 
that the war is going to be over in a matter of weeks. You heard him, it's
utter chaos out there. He's committing treason by doing this but now it looks
pretty certain that none of that is going to matter. His superiors have lost
their minds. It's 'Mutually Assured Destruction' from at least five sides in
this stupid war. If you're AI is anywhere near as good as what the whispers are
saying then we need to combine our projects. Are you up and running?"

"Why have you got immortal machines?" Doug had a stuttering, upper class twit
type of voice. One bred in Cambridge, a classic English nerd even down to the
clunky glasses.

"Because spaceships take a VERY long time to get between stars, haven't you been
listening?"

"Oh, oh, that's right, yes. Erm, are we going to other stars then?"

"Jesus! Doug you've not been listening at all have you? This Colonel here is
stealing bazillions of dollars of military funding and funneling it all into
getting the human embryo bank up to our lunar base. We're going to put them on
a fleet of my immortal machines so we can SURVIVE man! Survive as a race I
mean. Surely you heard that part?" Maya was all CIA, svelte and polished.

"Oh, of course, yes indeed, 'survive' yes, haha, indeed. Erm, where do I come in
to all.."

"For F..I swear Doug we've only just met but I'm going to brain you. What is
your research project?"

"It's, it's erm, artificial intelligence and quantum computing."

"Very good. Why might we need that in the plan I just mentioned do you think?"

"Oh, yes I see, it would be handy to have a really good, er, AI to co-ordinate a
project like that wouldn't it!"

"Right! Now is your machine up to that sort of a task do you think?"

"Let's see, erm, yes, erm, the quantum computation part of the puzzle is fully
integrated in our recent tests and Chalmers has cracked the other main bit, you
know, the er, space-time-mind equations have been solved. Do you see? Solved
finally, so ah, yes, the 'machine' isn't a machine any more, in actual fact, it
is genuinely sentient so far as we can tell that is, and has been for a few
years now, so.."

"That sounds fantastic, the rumours were true then! Now, at the double and top
top secret, you're bringing your team and all your tech and your getting on that
spaceflight the day after tomorrow. Got it? Can you do that?"

"Crumbs, er, right, thanks. Will there be any room for er, cats?

Maya could not believe that this was the man in charge of the most expensive,
the most daring, the most stupendous project that human kind had ever
undertaken. They were going to use her moon labs to integrate her
self-replication technology with this monster of an AI. If humanity was ever to
return to the Earth in any numbers then it would just HAVE to work. 

It looked like this weird Doug character was catching on at last, so that was
something. Dozens of similar conversations were being secretely held all over
the world. As warfare had gotten more extreme everything had started
collapsing. The leaders were found to be next to useless. They had got to the
top of their trees by saying the right things to the right people, but now they
had to DO the right things they were found to be bogged down in ideology and
thus frozen and inept.

Luckily, the layer of people just below the top turned out to be the ones with
the actual power. The ones no-one had heard of who built and ran the systems
everyone relied on. Personal relations between scientists built up through
conferences and inter-disciplinary initiatives had, over the years, enabled
them to outflank those supposedly in charge. The absolute nature of their task
had bulldozed through all the qualms anyone could raise. The various fields,
finance, military, science, technology, all had security built in to them. They
had simply taken over and locked out the higher ups who now found themselves
suddenly irrelevant. If things weren't so serious it would've been a lot of
fun.

A few days later the blast off from Cape Canaveral drowned out the small arms
fire that filled the air. The soldiery that protected them as they boarded were
firing at anyone that even might stop them. Doug, Maya and Colonel Nimes found
each other and strapped themselves into seats. This in itself was a minor
miracle. There were just over a thousand people on board, not counting the
embryo banks safely frozen in the hold. Doug had a little plastic crate. His
cat, 'Beenie' mewed pitifully.

As they cleared the tower and the ferocious G-forces mounted higher and higher,
they each one knew that this Leviathan X rocket was a life-raft and they
were leaving a sinking ship. It was a good thing that the whole launch and
flight was an automated process for every last one on board panicked.
