Colonel Nimes turned on the privacy cone. Maya let the gentle purple light play
on her fingers for a moment and then drew them back inside the envelope. They
hadn't needed any such security on Apollo Base.

"So we're expecting who now?" *I wonder if he's going to sidestep or tell me
it's Doug from Brain Labs.* She liked testing people out.

"It's perfectly safe. The field just interrupts signals. It's standard procedure
even for unclassified meetings. Ah, here's Doug now."

*He's certainly pretty fit under that, what is it, tweed? No, more like felt.*
She looked over the young man in his crisp uniform as he stepped out of the
skein of light to the door. He shook hands with a very awkward looking fellow
with weird hair, ginger, wavy and diagonal, but upwards. *How do you do that*
He clutched a satchel to his bosom. He panted and shuffled into the envelope.

Maya saw Doug's eyes widen behind his thick glasses when she stood to shake his
hand. The Colonel introduced them and they sat once more.

"Tell me, Doug, how's the AI research getting on? There are amazing rumours
about you lot you know."

The Colonel intervened. Leaning forward he said "Before we get into it, can I
just make it perfectly clear that if any of us get caught doing this we're going
to be executed. Not court-marshalled, not imprisoned, actually shot in the head,
executed! Now, we've been over a lot of this in the kryptokom channel but I need
to know how much each of you know as of right now. Maya?"

"You boys are going to fly your big Brain AI up to my lunar base and we're going
to make it live forever, of course."

Doug's eyes flitted between them. He still clung to his satchel. "What is the
ah, the actual status of the self-replication research?"

"I asked first. Big Brain Labs, where's it at?"

Doug looked at the Colonel who nodded.

"Let's see, the quantum computation part of the puzzle is fully integrated in
our recent tests and Chalmers has cracked the other main bit, you know, the
space-time-mind equations have been solved. Do you see? Solved finally, so the
'machine' isn't a machine any more, in actual fact, it is genuinely sentient so
far as we can tell that is, the singularity threshold has been maintained and
has been for a few years now, so.." He put his satchel on the sleek conference
table.

Maya opened her mouth but just as she began, the room shuddered as a jet
screamed overhead. They put their hands over their ears and involuntarily crouched.
The purple light skittered on-off-on-off-on. The rest of the room was in
complete darkness. There were no windows. Maya had thought they were further
underground. The Colonel stood and turned away, putting a finger to his ear. He
nodded a few times and turned back.

"One of ours. The fighting is getting pretty close so we're going to have to
wrap this up pretty soon, ok? Maya, let's have it."

The two men's eyes followed the exact same path as she lent down to pick up her
little container, long black hair tumbling. She really didn't look like any
scientist either of them had worked with before.

"Look'ee here boys" She turned the box over and out onto the table came what
Doug thought at first, was a nest of ants. Thousands of tiny black dots skated
over the table top. Doug pulled his satchel back to his bosom. As they watched,
all the dots began clumping together. They slowly rose into a jet black pyramid.

"That's resting state. This is a hive sample. Nanobots only yes, but these ones have
some tricks. You want to see? Go to kryptokom 99, that's the channel they're
programmed to sync with."

The two men pressed their fingers to their ears. Nothing.

"Oh, turn the privacy cone off for a moment would you?"

The purple light faded away and they were left with just the one overhead spot.

Maya leaned in toward the pyramid. "99 up. Sync. Initialise. Search."

The pyramid sprang apart and the dots fanned out across the table. They all
looked like they were bumping into each other. Doug and the Colonel sprang back.
A disembodied voice of young boy said "No components found. Reform." and they
all jiggled back to the centre of the table again and built back up into the
phenomenally black pyramid.

"Flippety!" said Doug.

Colonel Nimes looked Maya in the eye. "Ok, nice trick, but how can they build
anything?"

"Right, watch this. 99 up. Bond hash323." Over perhaps twenty seconds or so they
stared as the nanobots morphed into a cylindrical rod about seven inches long.
She picked it up and wrapped on the table with it. A little divot remained in
the wooden surface. She put the rod back in the box and said. "Privacy cone
please."

The Colonel obliged, she didn't see how, and said "This is a tiny sample. At
larger hive masses it has a distributed AI capacity that can build anything you
like. It will turn itself into whatever tool is necessary. There's a library of
shapes we've preprogrammed but that was just for development. It can work out
what it needs to be from the context its in. We've had it use hydroflouric
leaching on moon regolith and building a ton more of its own nanocomponents.
There, I told you, self-replication! We can get on with making real Von Neumann
probes now." She smiled broadly.

Colonel Nimes stood and clapped his hands. "Fantastic! Right so Doug, you get
your team and your rig to Florida in seven days time, right?" Doug nodded.
"Maya, please go with him and see if you can plan out a way to integrate. I've
got our people getting ready at the human embryo bank. If we do get caught it
won't make much difference. The word is that Mutually Assured Destruction is
coming at us inside of a month or two and that's from five different hostile
forces. A bullet or a nuclear bomb? I don't care anymore but what really matters
is getting those embryos to viable environments, right? The whole shebang is
falling apart but we're still good on security. The NASA guys are with us. Let's
rock, I'll see you both in a week."
