There have been loads of times that I've tried to get the ideas in this story
over to people. With so many failures behind me, I thought to set them out in a
longer version. More and more themes wanted to squeeze themselves in there. I
had to be firm and say 'no' to a bunch of 'em.

'Thesium' - latin 'of Thesius'.

The central symbol of the ship of Thesius could easily have been "grandfather's
axe" or "Trigger's broom" from Only Fools and Horses. It begs the question
'what is a thing?'

The brilliant images are by Damian, my eldest brother. More of his stuff can be
found on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/capn-damo).

The 'Abystery' is a version of Chenrezig.
