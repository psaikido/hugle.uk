The shushing sound of his gold brocade robe was loud enough for their
conversation to have to pause as the High Neem sat down. A deep frown darkened his
forehead as he leant back in his ornate chair. "My bishop, my friend, can we
still count upon the barons?"

"Why yes your Grace. There is no doubt as yet about their fealty."

"Good, good! And all the Evempiricals have been forced to recant?"

"All but a handful who have evaded us. It seems that the rebellion has lost
ground. We will redouble our efforts to bring them to justice, your Grace."

"See that it is so and quick mind you!"

"Of course, your Grace."

The High Neem adjusted the large opal ring on his forefinger and looked out of
the casement window. He saw the city rippling out beneath them. His eye followed
the concentric circles. The bastions of government first of all, he was fond of
their glorious towers and courtyards, and further distant, the security
perimeter with its watch towers and gates punctuating the massive walls. Beyond
the castling he dimly made out some of the bigger factories. They stood out
against the dark, chaotic smudges of the shanty towns that ringed them all. It
was there that his worried thoughts turned to most.

Everyone had seen the Ship of Light lying in parts. At least, everyone had heard
about it. The shock to the whole of Thesium was still reverberating and now,
even after the swift and brutal crackdowns that had followed, there were reports
that whole sections of the outer city had become no-go zones. The civil and
religious authority which he embodied had lost its grip out there.

"These damn Evempiricals, who the hell do they think they are?"

"Who indeed, your Grace."

"Okay, okay, knock it off with all the 'your Grace' business will you, we're in
trouble here and we need a plan."

"We could hold show trials perhaps? Bring in our very best theologians to
demonstrate to all that the evempirical ideas are simply wrong and unholy?"

"Mmm, yes, that could be done. Set up a meeting with the Cardinals at once. But
first tell me, when you saw the Ship of Light in parts like that, did you not
question the doctrine yourself? Even a little?"

"I fear such matters may be beyond my understanding your Grace. We look to you
for stability at these times."

"Oh, go and set up that meeting then will you - and begone!" He was irritated with these
sycophants now that he needed real counsel. Alas, it was he himself who had put
them in their roles. If he could have banished the White Coats entirely he would
have done so long ago. The Helper could not be done without though, the entire
infrastructure depended on it quietly running things behind the scenes. These
damn scientists knew how it all worked, or so they said, and hence the tiresome
business of compromise and politics had gone on. Now look!

Stepping over to his shrine in his red satin shoes, he gazed upon the statue.
The Ship's light beamed upwards into the Neemian heavens. He felt an old
reassurance as his faith reasserted itself. Yes, his inner world was indeed
connected to the divine. His soul knew!

Glancing out of the leaded windows once more he couldn't help but catch hold of
the tail end of a thought. "What if all MY parts could be laid out in the
Cathedral? What if it is all just a story? What then?"
