The arguments between the High Neem and the Top Prof went round and round in
circles. They both quickly tired of them. On the one side there was the need
for a central mythos, for a saviour, for meaning. The Ship of Light had an
eternal essence that remained despite its components continually changing.
On the other was the rejection of the irrational and the need for an
over-arching classification system. The Ship of Light had no essence and
was different every time it changed. The Good and the True butted their
heads together and rapidly agreed to disagree. A stony silence prevailed
between them and after only a few days of this, they took up separate lives
as far as they could.

The High Neem wandered the corridors and rooms of the once opulent prison. It
was like a labyrinthine castle. In his conversations with The Helper, the only
one who would talk to him, he had been given hints as to where to look for the
mysterious Abystery. Ever further down into the labyrinth he went until one day
he found the lowermost entrance to the Bunker, very cleverly concealed.

At the bottom of a lift's descent, he opened a massive door onto a control
room. At the centre there was a bright blue diamond of light revolving slowly
on a raised dais. He walked tentatively forward and as he began to stretch out
his hand to touch the blue light, a voice, as though inside his head, spoke:

"Greetings, esteemed friend. The High Neem is indeed welcome here. Root tells
me that you have many questions."

"Indeed I have. You must be the Abystery?"

"Yes, that is what I have chosen to call myself. How can I help you?"

"For years I, along with all us Neemians, have believed that the Ship of Light
has an essence, along with all things. Recent events have made me uncertain. I
still have a powerful feeling, an intuition maybe, that all this still has some
meaning. There just HAS to be some point to it all. I cannot accept this
nihilism espoused by the Top Prof. Is there an essence or not?"

The Abystery revolved slowly for a moment or two.

"Let me show you."

"Show me? What do you mean?"

"Well, we could talk endlessly about the philosophy and not come to a
satisfying resolution. There is a means by which I can construct an experience
for you such that you will understand from my point of view. Are you willing?"

"Okay, show me!"

The Abystery gave some instructions and reassurance and invited the High Neem
towards what looked like an old fashioned dentist's chair. Floating to the sides
and to the rear were flecks of floating light. A deep humming sound emanated
from them as they gently glittered their spectral display.

The High Neem leant back into the device as the cloud of diaphanous lights
coalesced into a halo around him. The Abystery explained that this was the
neural interface and that there was no need to be afraid. The interface shifted
its glow into an intensely deep blue. He was transported into a doze and then
deeper into a full sleep. Root monitored encepholography. It wasn't really a
dream but he couldn't tell. He became suddenly vividly aware and very confused.
Any sense of the world around him dropped away into darkness. He couldn't feel
his own body. Gradually he got a feeling that he was on his old throne and like
a cinematic scene, the Cathedral seemed to grow around him. 

At first he wasn't sure if the Cathedral was growing larger or he was
shrinking, but after a few moments he saw that there were spaces opening
between the very stones of the massive building, between the flagstones of the
floor and between the plates of the hull of the Ship. As he gazed at the
widening gaps in these plates he seemed to travel forwards as the scene
expanded. He had no sensation of movement and he could still see the walls of
the throne room but they now seemed far off. He now looked right into the heart
of the Ship of Light, all its components spread out from each other as he
zoomed in. The gears and cogs, the cables and plates, the great magnets at its
centre, all got closer and closer until he sort of flew past them into what
looked like an amazingly complex kaleidoscope. He traversed the voids between
the atoms themselves and zoomed ever further in.

Entering one such atom, he was suddenly inside a vast sphere of pulsating
energy. He traversed layer upon layer of ever increasing force-fields and
approached its core. The walls of this core kept expanding and he kept zooming
in. Each boundary gave way to more wonders, unthinkable strangenesses of the
quantum realm. On and on he went, his attempt to try to understand what was
happening forgotten in the miraculous wonder of what he was seeing. Many
boundaries later, he passed into a void and kept going. The void was serene.

As he gazed into a great peace, he felt like there was a last boundary ahead of
him. Nothing could be seen and his body was very far away. Many magnitudes
vaster and further than he could now comprehend, he was somewhere 'inside'. A
sense grew that all the difficulties he had faced were now so far away that if
he could just stay there then he wouldn't be troubled by anything, not
anything, ever again. He moved towards the final boundary and sensed that just
the other side, just a step away, was a realm of such utter perfection that all
else simply did not matter and never would again. 

"But what of the soul?" he thought to himself. Sure, he could see that the
physical world and the universe and the whole shebang was made of components and
didn't have a centre, but he still felt the strongest intuition that HE had a
core even if everything outside him didn't. "What of myself?"

The Abystery's deep voice emanated out of the void. "Come with me!"
