Captain Theo Nimes groaned with a deep refusal. Coming out of cryogenesis was
rough on anyone. The crew began to stir. 

Heavily climbing through layers of reanimation protocols, he gradually regained
consciousness. It was a burden. There was a period of disorientation accompanied
by a sense of unreality and so Root gave them plenty of time and a good deal of
gentle care. Their first needs were all physical but everyone of them felt
communication to be the number one priority. Where were they? Who are these
people? What are we doing here again? 

On wobbly legs they gathered gradually at the big external screens. Throughout
the ship little groups huddled together to gawp in wonder at the planet below.
Terraforming had been fabulously successful while they slept, circling their new
home from above its clouds.

The planet had few life-forms when they arrived but now that Root has been so
hard at work for so many years sending probes, autonomous machines and huge
swarms of nanobots, it had soil and drinkable water. It had seasons and
mountains and shores and forests. It had a balanced atmosphere and sparkling
rivers ran through the halcyon glades. This daughter of Gaia circled her strange
star at just the right distance, just the right speed. It was, well, just right!
A heaven in stark contrast to the hell left behind. 

Theo got on the ship-wide intercom. "Hello there my heroic colonists! Let's have
a big feast and a meeting to talk things over about what we're going to do.
Let's get together in Main Hall number one at seven this evening. You'll all be
happy to know that there have been no casualties, everything looks tip top and
the master plan is all set. Oh, and we're all seventy two years older than we
were a fortnight ago, happy birthday old timers! Out!"

Their celebratory meal had been a riot! It had taken quite a while to settle
everyone down for his talk, but they all knew that it was what they all wanted
to hear.  

"This here is our new star, over here the wormhole we've come out of and right
over there is home. We all know that we won't be returning, it's sad I know, but
this right here is where we have to MAKE our new home. You've all seen the
planet below by now and isn't she marvellous? (loud cheering) Root has
incredible things to show us by and by, but the first thing is our new base.
Root? please show us."

They screens showed the base from high drone footage. Nestled in the banks of
gentle hills, the landing site was clearly visible and looked ready for them.

"Hello everyone, you can call me 'Root'. We didn't get to know each other before
your stasis began but while you've been sleeping I have done the ground work, in
all literalness, and now need your help to further the building of
infrastructure. The intention is to build a central 3d-printing facility over
here and factory over there. We can bootstrap off our onboard replicators,
robotics can drill down into the planet, it's hot down there, and create a heat
exchange energy plant. Materials can be collected and taken to the factory which
will start on building the bigger stuff - dwellings, laboratories and
farms. Above all, we need a nursery. The first tranch of embryos need to start
their journeys. I'll need a computing and data collection facility which
we want to build underground to archive and process everything. You'll have
initial allocations already but all personel decisions will rest ultimately with
Captain Theo."

The days that followed were spent sending shuttles to and fro, further
establishing their base. Everyone had a multitude of tasks to perform and it was
only a week or so before engineering were ready to land the main ship. Stepping
on to their new home was a deep feeling for all of them. It was so much like the
earth that the joy in their hearts was the joy of a return. Their recognition of
this new planet must have come from very deep, atavistic sources, for not one of
them had ever bathed in a stream before. Lying in lush grass watching clouds
float by was novel for them all. They couldn't get enough of it.

And so it was that five full years of frenetic activity exploded forth on their
brand new world. Their activity centred around the moored ship which was used
primarily as an interim energy source. By the end of the fifth year its main
components had been repurposed and used in Root's primary infrastructure.
Theo's shuttle craft was now no longer used either. Everything they needed was now
close at hand. They kept it in central pride of place in the heart of their
emerging city. A symbol of their voyage to this beautiful new world. A symbolic
vessel carrying their torch of life into an uncertain future. A ship filled with
lights.
