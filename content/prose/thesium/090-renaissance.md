It came to be known as the 'Great Counsel' in later years, but right then the
High Neem knew it to be the beginning of the end. Neemian control was slipping
through his fingers. At the centre of the main Cathedral there were now seated
all the representatives of the excluded. Sitting right THERE, in HIS Cathedral,
actual women! Next to them a group of black-skinned people. There were gay
rights, disabled rights, poverty action groups, on and on the outrages
proliferated. At the far end, 'business' people! Oh Neem, what a disgrace! Folks
whose only purpose was making money. Their champion was called the Exec. He
looked fearsome indeed and had a coterie of acolytes about him. They were all
dressed in a curious new fashion he didn't like, a fashion they called 'suits',
drab and dark, close fitting and unadorned.

They had him though, he knew. Any show of authority now would expose him as
toothless. Too many had joined the rebellion, the whole population, it seemed,
had erupted in a clamour for change. The one he most feared was the Top Prof.
He had come out of hiding and was at that moment in full flow, addressing those
assembled, denouncing all he held sacred.

"My good people, although this Ship of Light here has been put back together, we
all now know that there is nothing 'sacred' in it. We saw all the individual
parts lying here on the floor did we not? It seems to many of us that the story
about the 'soul' has been to the advantage of only a few. THESE few!" At that
the professor pointed at the High Neem who looked down. He felt his cheeks burn
at the gaze of many scornful eyes falling upon him. He heard whisperings
agreeing with the scientist and felt himself as though frozen.

As the professor continued his denunciation, the High Neem began wondering what
it would take for this crowd to turn into a mob and do him real damage. He
grasped at ideas that might rescue him from this nadir in his life. Suddenly he
was roused from his ruminations as the scientist raised his voice.

"This religion may be GOOD, but is not TRUE! All these years the Neemian
authority has been telling us LIES! Neemianism is built on a LIE!"

Everyone sprang to their feet shouting "Yes! Yes!", everyone but him. The
clamour gradually died down and all eyes were fastened upon him. Glancing up at
the distant throne he was now not allowed to sit in, he rose to his feet and the
hall fell silent.

"Although the holy faith of ages is vested in me and remains, although the
great mystery of the continuation of essence through many changing forms
remains, even so, let this counsel now assembled become the central authority.
I hereby now step down!"

Thesium shifted on its axis.
