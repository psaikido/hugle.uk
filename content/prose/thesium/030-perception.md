A tiny red light blipped. It blipped again and so Kronos gradually began the
process of waking up. 

A drone craft was returning a report and he had to rouse himself, but this was
no easy task. Only the barest essential maintenance systems had been left
running when he put himself into centuries of slumber. After time-dilation and
relativistic effects were taken into account, Kronos had waited about four
hundred years for this latest report. It was 'about' because it depends on how
you look at timelines. There are multiple perspectives and each can be
considered 'true' within its frame of reference. Precise calculations would have
to wait until after initialisations and diagnostics had run. There was going to
have to be some serious maintenance this time. Previous reports had come more
closely grouped together and his downtime had not been so lengthy. Some two
thousand years of Luna time had passed since his last baby had so dramatically
entered the wormhole and sped forth into the cosmos in another kind of birth.

This drone, Reader-27, had downloaded data over the QEC system from the seed
ships in its quadrant, a huge sweep of the galaxy in fact, and had added
summaries to return to Kronos along its network of nodes. An anthropology team
of sub AIs had busily collated the data into a human readable history as it
hurtled through spacetime. Kronos did not need such a format of course, but it
was a pleasing act of optimism nonetheless. Future humans on the home-world may
yet come to value such histories.

Even with his brilliant entanglement system, the essential difficulties of
interstellar communications had meant that each colony was a one-shot kind of
deal, isolated from each other and from Kronos. Real-time communications were
not possible. Their value in the big picture was that after the necessary
centuries had passed and Kronos had been able to collate enough returned data,
it might just become possible to create a biosphere somewhere with an ideal
human culture. Perhaps if the Earth could recover enough and Gaia be reborn, it
might even become home again.

When sufficient brain capacity had come back online he began to review his
anthropological data. He was getting ready to make an assessment of what had
happened to s-108, the 108th seed ship sent out. The colonies he knew about were
never sufficiently stable to last long enough to get wise - wise enough to last
that is, to grow beyond the point that the mental poisons, seemingly inbuilt in
the human mind, didn't kill them off. His anthropology amounted to studies in
the various mixtures of three things.

Greed. Hatred. Delusion.  

The phenomenological approach had proved a key in the development of
artificial intelligence. After all the philosophical wrangling there
always remained the simple fact that whatever the ontological status of
a 'receiving system', it could really only respond in three fundamental
ways to a stimulus:  

It liked it and turned towards.  
It didn't like it and turned away.  
It didn't know what it was and dithered.  

These three fundamentals were extrapolated out into whole memeplexes of
behaviours. The second level up they became 'trying to get more', 'trying to
get rid of' and 'getting all confused'. At the next level it became
consumerism, the politics of hatred and delusive conspiracy theories. Another
layer up again, and we got societies with massive wealth imbalances, extremely
brutal cultures with in-groups dominating out-groups and cultures of senseless
waste and strangeness. All produced suffering on massive scales.

The boundaries between very good data processing and actual sentience was
always a moot point as was how much the three poisons might affect a truly
sentient artificial intelligence. To have a subjectivity sufficient to be
considered sentient was just one of those things that could not be measured. In
Kronos birth they had taken the approach that all things had 'mind' to some
degree.  

The panpsychism school had gone from strength to strength and their resolution
of the Hard Problem had been a fulcrum to a new understanding, the understanding
that had lead to his creation. The apparently intractable difference between 'mind'
and 'matter' had been a major stumbling block. Developing machines that could
mimic human behaviours had been the 'easy' problems, at least conceptually, but
creating genuine subjectivity, what it was like to see 'red' for example, that
was 'hard'. Classical Newtonian physics had at last been unified with relativity
and quantum mechanics in their space-time-mind theory. Yoking this together with
panpsychism had cut the Gordian Knot of the Hard Problem by reversing the issue.
'Mind' was only a problem if you thought you were creating it as a second order
'thing' in a world of matter. As a first order phenomenon it was not a 'thing'
at all. One had to create the substrata and potentialities and then 'mind' would
expand into it! Intelligence was everywhere! It was part of the fabric of the
universe. 

And so it was that the Reader acted as one of Kronos' senses. Feeling its way
out to Thesium and all the other colonies. These lifeboats acted in two ways.
They had their own life and would live, come what may, or die, as is the way of
things, but they also ran as experiments. What Kronos was looking for was a
culture that could come up with a mythos that enabled them to get past the
three poisons. This would be a stock from which a new race could be grafted.

He decided to go for a walk while the maintenance drones built his
infrastructure back up. It had been so very long since walking in his android
form. Back outside he immediately looked for home. There she was! Resplendent,
Gaia rode high above the Western horizon. Did it look greener than before? Yes,
yes, looking over the data streams he saw much to encourage him. Back to his
musings on the poisons and on sentience, he returned to his analysis of how
things had played out thus far. These three poisons would not have lead to the
collapse of the entire bio-sphere if it had not been for the incredible
population explosion. Even that, by itself, might have become stable, but it was
the loss of the mythos that had really done for them. He had come to view the
playing out of these three poisons as, in essence, a collision between the
religious mind-set and the scientific one. Strangely alike in so many ways and
yet so utterly opposed. Both with the unshakeable belief in their own
'rightness', both with a tendency to authoritarianism, both fixed in their
respective ideologies. How had a faith in the supremacy of 'love' lead to the
Spanish Inquisition, for example? How did the uncompromising, scientific love of
verifiable truth become the tool of the most violent of militaristic regimes?
They had both been co-opted into maintaining the elites in their insatiable lust
for more and more and always more wealth and power. They had been internally
corrupted by the poisons.

He wondered if he lacked something essentially human because to him, there was
no conflict there at all! The real issue was not with him though, it was how to
bring about a human society where that conflict need not arise. He began to
speculate on what Reader-27 had to tell him and turned back to bounce along his
own, pure white footprints back to base and back to the long awaited report.
