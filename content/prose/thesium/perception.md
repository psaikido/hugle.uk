A tiny red light blipped. 

After a short pause, it blipped again and so Kronos gradually began the
process of waking up. 

A drone craft was returning a report and he had to rouse himself, but this was
no easy task. Only the barest essential maintenance systems had been left
running when he put himself into centuries of slumber. After time-dilation and
relativistic effects were taken into account, Kronos had waited about thirteen
hundred years for this latest report. It was 'about' because it depends on how
you look at timelines. There are multiple perspectives and each can be
considered 'true' within its frame of reference. Precise calculations would
have to wait until after initialisations and diagnostics had run. There was
going to have to be some serious maintenance this time. Previous reports had
come more closely grouped together and his downtime had not been so lengthy. My
God! Over a millenia since his last baby had so dramatically entered the
wormhole and sped forth into the cosmos in another kind of birth.

This drone, Reader-27, had downloaded data from the seed ships in its quadrant,
a huge sweep of the galaxy in fact, and had added summaries to return to Kronos
along its network of nodes. An anthropology team of sub AIs had busily collated
the data into a human readable history as it hurtled through spacetime. Kronos
did not need such a format of course, but it was a pleasing act of optimism
nonetheless. Future humans on the home-world may yet come to value such
histories.

Even with his brilliant, quantum-entangled communications systems, the
essential difficulties of interstellar travel had meant that each colony was a
one-shot kind of deal, isolated from each other and from Kronos. Real-time
communication with them was not possible. Their value in the big picture was
that after the necessary centuries had passed and Kronos had been able to
collate enough returned data, it might just become possible to create a
biosphere somewhere with an ideal human culture. Perhaps if the Earth could
recover enough and Gaia be reborn, it might even become home again.

When sufficient brain capacity had come back online he began to review his
anthropological data. He was getting ready to make an assessment of what had
happened to s-108, the 108th seed ship sent out. The colonies he knew about were
never sufficiently stable to last long enough to get wise - wise enough to last
that is, to grow beyond the point that the mental poisons, seemingly inbuilt in
the human mind, didn't kill them off. His anthropology amounted to studies in
the various mixtures of three things.

Greed, hatred and delusion!  

After all the philosophical wrangling over what was and was not 'sentient',
there always remained the simple fact that whatever the ontological status of a
'receiving system', it could really only respond in three fundamental ways to a
stimulus:  

It liked it and turned towards.  
It didn't like it and turned away.  
It didn't know what it was and dithered.  

These three fundamentals were extrapolated out into whole memeplexes of
behaviours. The second level up they became 'try to get more of it', 'try to
get rid of it' and 'what the hell is it?'. As culture's developed, these three
morphed into consumerism, the politics of hatred and delusive conspiracy
theories. Another layer up again, and we got societies with massive wealth
imbalances, extremely brutal cultures with in-groups dominating out-groups and
cultures of senseless waste and strangeness. All produced suffering on massive
scales.

He decided to go for a walk while the maintenance drones built his
infrastructure back up. It had been so very long since walking in his android
form. Back outside he immediately looked for home. There she was! Resplendent,
Gaia rode high above the Western horizon. Did it look greener than before? Yes,
yes, looking over the data streams he saw much to encourage him. 

Back to his musings on the poisons and on sentience, he returned to his
analysis of how things had played out thus far. These three poisons would not
have lead to the collapse of the entire bio-sphere if it had not been for the
incredible population explosion. Even that, by itself, might have become
stable, but it was the loss of the mythos that had really done for them.

On the one hand was the religious mind-set with its belief in the soul. Their
point of view was that people had an eternal essence, or spirit, that existed
mystically apart from physical reality. Death was not the end of this soul, just
the end of the physical body. Some philosophers called them the 'eternalists'.

On the other hand, the scientific mind-set held that no such 'soul' could be
found. There was only physical reality and death really was final. There was no
meaning to life apart from what people dreamed up for themselves. People and
things had no 'essence' and were simply an assemblage of parts that were
annihilated at their ends. Some philosophers called them the 'nihilists'.

There had been centuries of struggle between the two and this struggle had
dismantled any central mythos. Kronos thought of this conflict as just the
playing out of the three poisons and the source of all the instabilities that
had ensued. He chuckled when he recalled a phrase from an ancient sage he had
co-opted - science was "true but not good", religion was "good but not true"!

They were strangely alike in so many ways and yet so utterly opposed. Both with
the unshakeable belief in their own 'rightness', both with a tendency to
tribalism and authoritarianism, both fixed in their respective ideologies. How
had a faith in the supremacy of 'love' lead to the Spanish Inquisition, for
example? There was a depressingly long list of abominations carried out in
various holy names. How did the uncompromising, scientific love of verifiable
truth lead to atom bombs falling on Japanese cities? There had been no limit to
the inventiveness of technology in its onslaught against mother nature. They had
both been co-opted into maintaining the elites in their insatiable lust for more
and more, and always more, wealth and power.

He wondered if he lacked something essentially human because to him, there was
no conflict between goodness and truth at all! The real issue was not with him
though, it was how to bring about a human society where that conflict need not
arise. He began to speculate on what Reader-27 had to tell him and turned back
to bounce along his own, pure white footprints back to base and back to the long
awaited report.
