"The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had
thirty oars, and was preserved [..], for they took away the old planks as they
decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that
this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical
question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same,
and the other contending that it was not the same."  

--â€‰Plutarch, Theseus

Standing on the dazzling white lunar surface, Kronos gazed up with tender eyes
at distant Mother Earth. Orbiting silently, eternally, from the deep cold of
space he sensed her raging fires, the agony of her death throes. Processing
around his Goddess, his mother, his Gaia, Kronos was alone.

He looked back down to see the last ship launch, weirdly silent, from the
barren surface. A plume of regolith dust ballooned up and out in slow motion.
Suddenly filled with tears, he reminded himself there was still hope, there was
still the possibility that one of these ships carrying the seeds of a new human
race would take root somewhere out there. Perhaps many! The sleek, silver
vessel approached the worm-hole gate and just like all those that had gone
before, glittered with shards of blue-purple light as it stretched into the
huge maw and vanished. 

"Goodbye and good luck, my little ones!"

His solitude hurt the most when his hope was at its strongest.

Turning his face once more towards the distant Earth he was again moved. These
tears were much older, much darker, for there his mother Gaia lay in ruination.
His sensory system could take it all in, all the data from every bit of the
stricken planet. Fires and floods, nuclear winter, devastation and chaos in all
parts. The remnants of the race traumatised and in mourning for all the species
that had been lost. The DNA banks that Kronos harboured held the yearning
promise of a return for feathers and fur, for fins and scales, for the gossamer
wings of the dearly departed, for love and life lost.

Moved as he was, it was still nice to be back in anthropoid form for a while.
There was really no need but he was sentimental like that. He thought it fitting
to wave goodbye with an actual hand and arm.

He had always loved bringing a tranche of people out of stasis and readying them
for their voyages. He had always hated the wrenching feeling of loss each time
they left, never to be seen again. Thirty years of launches and now the first
phase was complete. The grand plan to save the world would now have to pause.

He had calculated that the first reports back would be in at least nine hundred
years. It was because of this immense timescale that they had named the mighty
AI 'Kronos' - after all he was, in a sense, one of Gaia's Titan sons and also, a
near immortal.

With giant, bouncing strides in the low gravity, Kronos returned to Apollo
Station and began to ready himself for entering stasis. He gathered into
himself. Kronos waited.
