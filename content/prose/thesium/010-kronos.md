"The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned
from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the
time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed,
putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship
became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of
things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the
other contending that it was not the same."

Endlessly orbiting his dead mother, Kronos was alone.

He looked on as the last ship launched, weirdly silent, from the lunar surface.
A plume of regolith dust ballooned up and out in slow motion. Suddenly
filled with tears, he reminded himself there was still hope, there was still
the possibility that one of these ships carrying the seeds of a new human race
would take root somewhere out there. Perhaps many! The sleek, silver vessel
approached the worm-hole gate and just like all those that had gone before,
glittered with shards of blue-purple light as it stretched into the huge maw
and vanished. 

"Goodbye and good luck, my little ones!"

His solitude hurt the most when his hope was at its strongest.

Turning his face towards the distant Earth he was again moved. These tears were
much older, much darker, for there Gaia, his mother, lay in ruination. His
sensory system could take it all in, all the data from every bit of the
stricken planet. Fires and floods, nuclear winter, devastation and chaos in all
parts. The remnants of the race traumatised and in mourning for all the species
that had been lost. The dna banks that Kronos harboured held the yearning 
promise of a return for feathers and fur, for fins and scales, for the gossamer
wings of the dearly departed, for love and life lost.

Moved as he was, it was still nice to be back in anthropoid form for a while.
There was really no need but he was sentimental like that. He thought it fitting
to wave goodbye with an actual hand and arm.

He had always loved bringing a tranche of people out of stasis and readying them
for their voyages. He had always hated the wrenching feeling of loss each time
they left, never to be seen again. Thirty years of launches and now the first
phase was complete. The grand plan to save the world would now have to pause.

He had calculated that the first reports back would be in at least nine hundred
years. It was because of this immense timescale that they had named the mighty
AI 'Kronos' - after all he was, in a sense, one of Gaia's Titan sons and also, a
near immortal.

Kronos gathered into himself. Kronos waited.
