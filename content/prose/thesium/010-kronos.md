Endlessly orbiting his dead mother, Kronos was alone.

He looked on as the last ship launched, weirdly silent, from the lunar surface.
A plume of regolith dust ballooned up and out in slow motion. Suddenly
filled with tears, he reminded himself there was still hope, there was still
the possibility that one of these ships carrying the seeds of a new human race
would take root somewhere out there. Perhaps many! The sleek, silver vessel
approached the worm-hole gate and just like all those that had gone before,
glittered with shards of blue-purple light as it stretched into the huge maw
and vanished. 

"Goodbye and good luck, my little ones!"

His solitude hurt the most when his hope was at its strongest.

Turning his face towards the distant Earth he was again moved. These tears
were much older, much darker, for there Gaia, his mother, lay in ruination.
His sensory system could take it all in, all the data from every bit of the
stricken planet. Fires and floods, nuclear winter, devastation and chaos in all
parts.

Moved as he was, it was still nice to be back in anthropoid form for a while.
There was really no need but he was sentimental like that. He thought it fitting
to wave goodbye with an actual hand and arm.

He had always loved bringing a tranche of people out of stasis and readying them
for their voyages. He had always hated the wrenching feeling of loss each time
they left, never to be seen again. Thirty years of launches and now the first
phase was complete.

He had calculated that the first reports back would be in at least nine hundred
years. It was because of this immense timescale that they had named the mighty
AI 'Kronos' - after all he was, in a sense, one of Gaia's Titan sons and also, a
near immortal.

Kronos gathered into himself. Kronos waited.
