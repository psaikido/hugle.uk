Doug glanced over his shoulder and turned back to his systems administrator.
"Ok Steve my old chum, it's time to kick out management." He pushed his glasses
back up his nose. *Oh Jesus we're going to get hung for this.* 

He glanced at his watch - 2:30am. The office was dark, they didn't want to
attract attention. He leaned over his friend's shoulder and watched as the
tappety tap fingers committed high treason and half a dozen other crimes at the
same time. *Let's see, that's treason and cybercrime and mm, fraud maybe?*

The security at Brain Labs was state-of-the-art but he had global superuser
access as the lead developer and the sysadmin was all in on their insurrection
too. In precisely three lines of code they reconfigured the main security
system. Everyone above level 5 access were booted off. All the suits, gone. Simple!

"Top job Steve, you may have just saved the world." *I've never seen Steve this
way - is he going to cry?* He put his hand on Steve's shoulder. "Let's find out
how the others are doing, ok?" There was an awkward pause until Steve nodded. 

Doug got on the kryptokom channel and called 'chipmonk99'. *Let's try to sound
casual this time.* "How's the jolly old insurrection at your end? We've locked out
management here." *Not too bad, at least you didn't stutter.*

The slightly crackly sound of the distant technician was clear enough in Doug's
earpiece. "Yeah baby! We got internet4's Western backbone yesterday. We got the
NASA boys and Apollo base but are still waiting to hear about the embryo bank.
From the coms point of view it looks like we've got a clear run to the moon!" 

Steve smiled and stuck up his thumb. He had patched into the channel too. He
asked "Please tell us that the NSA have been kicked out?"

"First thing we did. In fact all the spooks should be out of the picture. The
CIA are trying to fight back but they've got no chance. Maya's got the keys to
the kingdom over there."

"Top job Chipmonk, see you luna-side." Doug ended the call. He couldn't quite
bring himself to believe that things had come to this, that things had gotten
this bad. Societies all around the world had begun collapsing under the multiple
pressures of global warming, civil insurrections and not least, the major powers
at war. Those who were trying to fix things and give life on Earth a chance had
found themselves sidelined. Governments and institutions continued as they had
before, as though sleep-walking. Proposals to move embryo banks and DNA stores
to safer storage on the moon were ignored by administrations determined to keep
the illusion of control even in the face of disaster. A group of scientific
researchers had met in Geneva and had decided to take matters into their own
hands. Waiting for the authorities to act was no longer a viable option. They
were going to simply steal their own research projects away onto the already
long established moon base Apollo, get the embryo and DNA stores there and then
try and figure something out. Somebody had to, the fates had decreed that it was
going to be them. Willing hands had appeared everywhere and yet the forces of
the status-quo were still going to try and stop them - out of intertia? - out of
spite? It was hard to tell. They were so distracted by the general collapse that
their efforts had so far proved uncoordinated and ineffective.

Despite all the qualms about making such a move, it had turned out to be a
simple thing. A few of the key people, a couple of systems engineers here, a
Chief Technical Officer there, and hey presto, their operation to commandeer
spaceflight and a handful of the planet's most advanced research projects was
in the bag - nearly. 

Doug said "Right, Steve, we've got to power down the Brain and load everything
into the, the what did we get for it now?"

"It's just a regular lorry container. It's ready in the loading dock. It
shouldn't attract any attention on the way to the airport."

*Oh my giddy aunt! That's liquid nitrogen in the vault. What the fuck happens if
it gets above 70 Kelvin?* "Ok, so we'll need to move it at, let's see, 5am ok?"

The kryptokom flashed. He put his finger to his ear and held his hand up to
Steve - apparently it was a private message.

"Right. Right ok. So the embryo bank is blasting off from, from where did you
say?" *Shit, they were supposed to be with us.* "Kazakstan? Got it, ok thanks." 

He turned back to Steve who also had his finger to his ear having his own
private call. Steve looked alarmed.

"Doug, Dougie oh shit, they're saying there's some military at the perimeter. It
looks like they might be onto us. Someone's blabbed!"

*Fuckity fuckity fuckity fuck* "Get the monitors up would you Steve?" On the
little monitor they could see a humvee at the outer perimeter gate. Their own
security looked like they were aware of it. They could see them having a confab
behind the inner wall.

"Management must've figured it out. Jesus, they look like real soldiers with
real guns and everything" Doug said. *How long have we got before they get
backup?* "I'll get onto the Colonel." 

"Theo? Theo? Er Colonel, Sir, is that you? There's a dozen chaps with big guns
at our gates. It looks like they are going to try and stop us getting the lorry
to the airport. Um, we're a bit stuck you see.. Yes..? Three hours? Ok."

"He says he's got some contacts over here and he's getting us some help. Air
support at, what's that? 5:40. Right, I'll get my team moving. Can we hold them
off until then?"

"It looks like it at the moment. What's that, half a platoon? They don't look
like they have enough for an assault. They look a bit disorganised to be honest,
we should be ok for now but let's get cracking, ok?"

Doug walked out to the dev lab and found the security doors propped open. His
raggle-taggle team of uber-nerds stood about nervously waiting for him.

"Right you lot, it's time, so everything just like we practiced ok?" They sprang
into action and for the next few hours the nerves eased up. It was much better
when there was something to concentrate on. Moving the most advanced artificial
intelligence ever created into a big metal box along with its power supply and
cryovault was a very ticklish business. 

He heard some rifle fire in the distance as they waited on the compound's
forecourt. The soldiers outside had not been reinforced and hadn't made a move
on the compound as yet. Everyone kept flinching at the sound of the firing but
then a loud chunk chunk sound came over the nearby hill. All faces turned
toward a massive helicopter swooping towards them in the first, glorious flush
of dawn. It slowed to a hover, thud thudding over the compound. He ran back
inside and scooped up his laptop, a shoulder bag and a cat box. When he came
back out he saw a group of soldiers abseiling down from the huge chopper. They
got to work attaching the container and at the last minute shoved Doug, his
staff and themselves into the container along with the AI. 

Everyone was cheek by jowl as they took off. Bullets could be heard slamming
into the metal box as they swung up into the Cambridgeshire afternoon. Doug's
head swam with the scent of the young woman's hair he was jammed up against. He
was more embarrassed than afraid. "Gosh, so, it's Gemma isn't it?"

There were no further incidents, the chopper delivered them and their precious
cargo to the airport and they all slept soundly on the trans Atlantic flight.
They met more opposition at Cape Canaveral though. Nimes and Maya met them off
the plane and took them and the container on a fast road trip accompanied by a
platoon of GIs in humvees. This lot were on their side. At the base, small arms
fire filled the air, there were still some military who were organised enough to
try and keep control. The soldiery that protected them as they boarded were
firing at anyone that even might stop them. Doug, Gemma, Maya and Colonel Nimes
strapped themselves into seats. There were just over a thousand people on board
the massive space shuttle. From Doug's little plastic crate, his cat 'Beenie'
mewed pitifully.

As they cleared the tower and the ferocious G-forces mounted higher and higher,
every soul on board knew that this Leviathan X rocket was a life-raft and they
were leaving a sinking ship. It was a good thing that the whole launch and
flight was automated, for every last one on board was panicking.
