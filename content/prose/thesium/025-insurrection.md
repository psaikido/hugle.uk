Doug glanced over his shoulder, turned back to his console and pushed his
glasses back up his nose. *In for a penny.* Tappety tap went his fingers as he
committed high treason and a bunch of other crimes at the same time. *Let's
see, that's treason and cybercrime and mm, fraud maybe?*

The security at Brain Labs was state-of-the-art but because he had global
superuser access, it had been child's play to take over entirely. In precisely
three lines of code he had reconfigured the whole security system. Everyone above
level 5 access where booted off. Simple!

He got on the kryptokom channel and called 'chipmonk99'. "How's the
in..insurrection at your end? We've locked out management here."

"Yeah baby! We got internet4's Western backbone yesterday. We got the NASA
boys and Apollo base but are still waiting to hear about the embryo bank." 

"You have to tell me that NSA have been kicked?"

"First thing we did. In fact all the spooks should be out of the picture. The
CIA are trying to fight back but they've got no chance."

Despite all the qualms about making such a move, it had turned out to be a
simple thing. A few of the key people, a couple of systems engineers here, a
Chief Technical Officer there, and hey presto, their operation to commandeer
spaceflight and a handful of the planet's most advanced research projects was
in the bag - nearly.

A few days later Doug heard that the embryo bank was going on another Leviathan
rocket launching from Kazakstan. He only had to concentrate on getting his rig
and his people to Florida. No one had slept for too long and things were getting
fraught. The plane was all lined up but getting to the runway was the problem.
The rig had to be kept supercool, not far from absolute zero in fact. The whole
shebang just about fitted into a container lorry, power supply and all, but the
lab had been surrounded by soldiers and they couldn't drive it out.

The clock kept ticking.

Someone must've blabbed, or maybe management had figured it out, but these were
real soldiers with real guns and they meant to stop them stealing the AI.
Doug's people were co-ordinating their own security in an armed standoff while
Doug scrambled to talk to Colonel Nimes.

"Theo, Theo, er Sir, is that you? There's two dozen chaps with big guns stopping
the lorry getting to the airport. Um, we're a bit stuck you see.."

"Ok understood. Sit tight, I've got some contacts over there and I'll get you
some help, don't worry. Out."

He heard shouting and some rifle fire after about half an hour but then a loud
chunk chunk sound came over the nearby hill. A massive helicopter swooped
towards them and slowed to a hover, thud thudding over the compound. Scooping up
his laptop, a shoulder bag and a cat box, he ran out to meet it. A group of
soldiers, apparently identical to the guys outside, stood beside their dangling
abseil ropes. They got to work attaching the container and at the last minute
shoved Doug, his staff of fifteen and themselves into the container along with
the AI. Everyone was cheek by jowl as they took off. Bullets could be heard
slamming into the metal box as they swung up into the Cambridgeshire afternoon.
Doug's head swam with the scent of the young woman he was jammed up against. He
was more embarrassed than afraid. "Gosh, so, it's Gemma isn't it?"

There were no further incidents and they all slept soundly on the
trans Atlantic flight. They met more opposition at Cape Canaveral though. Nimes
and Maya met them off the plane and took them and the container on a fast road
trip accompanied by a platoon of GIs in humvees. At the base, small arms fire
filled the air. The soldiery that protected them as they boarded were firing at
anyone that even might stop them. Doug, Maya and Colonel Nimes strapped
themselves into seats. There were just over a thousand people on board the
massive space shuttle. From Doug's little plastic crate, his cat 'Beenie' mewed
pitifully.

As they cleared the tower and the ferocious G-forces mounted higher and higher,
every soul on board knew that this Leviathan X rocket was a life-raft and they
were leaving a sinking ship. It was a good thing that the whole launch and
flight was an automated process for every last one on board was panicking.
