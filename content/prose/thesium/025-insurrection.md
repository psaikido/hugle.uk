Doug glanced over his shoulder and turned back to his systems administrator.
"Ok Steve my old chum, it's time to kick out management." He pushed his glasses
back up his nose. *Oh Jesus we're going to get hung for this.* 

He glanced at his watch - 2:30am. The office was dark, they didn't want to
attract attention. He leaned over his friend's shoulder and watched as the
tappety tap fingers committed high treason and half a dozen other crimes at the
same time. *Let's see, that's treason and cybercrime and mm, fraud maybe?*

The security at Brain Labs was state-of-the-art but he had global superuser
access as the lead developer and the sysadmin was all in on their insurrection
too. In precisely three lines of code they reconfigured the main security
system. Everyone above level 5 access were booted off. All the suits, gone. Simple!

"Top job Steve, you may have just saved the world." *I've never seen Steve this
way - is he going to cry?* He put his hand on Steve's shoulder. There was an
awkward pause until Steve nodded. "Let's find out how the others are doing, ok?"

He got on the kryptokom channel and called 'chipmonk99'. *Let's try to sound
casual this time.* "How's the jolly old insurrection at your end? We've locked out
management here." *Not too bad, at least you didn't stutter.*

"Yeah baby! We got internet4's Western backbone yesterday. We got the NASA boys
and Apollo base but are still waiting to hear about the embryo bank. From the
coms point of view it looks like we've got a clear run to the moon!" 

Steve smiled and stuck up his thumb.

"You have to tell me that the NSA have been kicked?"

"First thing we did. In fact all the spooks should be out of the picture. The
CIA are trying to fight back but they've got no chance. Maya's got the keys to
the kingdom over there."

Despite all the qualms about making such a move, it had turned out to be a
simple thing. A few of the key people, a couple of systems engineers here, a
Chief Technical Officer there, and hey presto, their operation to commandeer
spaceflight and a handful of the planet's most advanced research projects was
in the bag - nearly.

"Right, Steve, we've got to power down the Brain and load everything into the,
the what is it?"

"It's a lorry container, Doug, sheesh! It's ready in the loading dock."

*Oh my giddy aunt! That's liquid nitrogen in the vault. What the fuck happens if
it gets above 70 Kelvin?* "Ok, so we'll need to move it at, let's see, 5am ok?"

The kryptokom flashed. He put his finger to his ear and held his hand up to
Steve.

"Right. Right ok. So the embryo bank is blasting off from, from where did you
say?" *Shit, they were supposed to be with us.* "Kazakstan? Got it, ok thanks." 

He turned back to Steve who also had his finger to his ear. He looked alarmed.

"Doug, Dougie oh shit, they're saying there's some military at the perimeter. It
looks like they might be onto us. Someone's blabbed!"

*Fuckity fuckity fuckity fuck* "Get the monitors up would you Steve?" On the
little monitor they could see a humvee at the outer perimeter gate. Their own
security looked like they were aware of it. They could see them having a confab
behind the inner wall.

"Management must've figured it out. Jesus, they look like real soldiers with
real guns and everything." *How long have we got before they get backup?* "I'll
get onto the Colonel." 

"Theo? Theo? Er Colonel, Sir, is that you? There's a dozen chaps with big guns
at our gates. It looks like they are going to try and stop us getting the lorry
to the airport. Um, we're a bit stuck you see.. Yes..? Three hours? Ok."

"He says he's got some contacts over here and he's getting us some help. Air
support at, what's that? 5:40. Right, I'll get my team moving."

He walked out to the dev lab and found the security doors propped open. His
raggle-taggle team of uber-nerds stood about nervously waiting for him.

"Right you lot, it's time, so everything just like we practiced ok?" They sprang
into action and for the next few hours the nerves eased up. It was much better
when there was something to concentrate on. Moving the most advanced artificial
intelligence ever created into a big metal box along with its power supply and
cryovault was a very ticklish business. 

He heard some rifle fire in the distance as they waited on the compound's
forecourt. Everyone kept flinching but then a loud chunk chunk sound came over
the nearby hill. All faces turned toward a massive helicopter swooping towards
them. It slowed to a hover, thud thudding over the compound. He ran back inside
and scooped up his laptop, a shoulder bag and a cat box. When he came back out
he saw a group of soldiers abseiling down from the huge chopper. They got to work
attaching the container and at the last minute shoved Doug, his staff and
themselves into the container along with the AI. 

Everyone was cheek by jowl as they took off. Bullets could be heard slamming
into the metal box as they swung up into the Cambridgeshire afternoon. Doug's
head swam with the scent of the young woman's hair he was jammed up against. He
was more embarrassed than afraid. "Gosh, so, it's Gemma isn't it?"

There were no further incidents and they all slept soundly on the
trans Atlantic flight. They met more opposition at Cape Canaveral though. Nimes
and Maya met them off the plane and took them and the container on a fast road
trip accompanied by a platoon of GIs in humvees. At the base, small arms fire
filled the air. The soldiery that protected them as they boarded were firing at
anyone that even might stop them. Doug, Maya and Colonel Nimes strapped
themselves into seats. There were just over a thousand people on board the
massive space shuttle. From Doug's little plastic crate, his cat 'Beenie' mewed
pitifully.

As they cleared the tower and the ferocious G-forces mounted higher and higher,
every soul on board knew that this Leviathan X rocket was a life-raft and they
were leaving a sinking ship. It was a good thing that the whole launch and
flight was automated, for every last one on board was panicking.
