#### spider

This is the first kite I got in the summer of 2020.  
It is vented and so can be flown in high winds without pulling too hard.  
I love it!


#### tarantula

Bigger than the spider, hence 'tarantula', this one is just all round
brilliant. It has quite a broad range and can handle most conditions and still
look really sharp.  Most of the [club38](https://revkites.com/club-38/)
patterns were flown with this one. It is very responsive and stable at the same
time. Brilliant! These are customised colours.

I got this lovely kite for low wind days, below 10mph. It seems to do best on short lines when the wind is low. Amazing performance on the normal 80ft lines and a good wind. I went for the 'standard vent' model. It's the prettiest!


#### blast

This is the monster! Really fast and pulls hard. It is from the 'speed series'
of revolution kites. The [club38](https://revkites.com/club-38/) levels done
with one of the speed series is for the 'Triple Master' title.


#### XX

The Reflex [XX](https://revkites.com/product/revolution-reflex-xx/) is like the
Tarantula but unvented. It is sooo responsive and sharp. For wind around
12-15mph when it's smooth, this is just the most lovely thing. Custom colours,
I think of them as the 'Batman' scheme.

#### Microlite

Super light-weight and great for low wind days. I love the 'bubblegum' feel to
the colours and the beehive hexagons. Top fun!

#### fulcrum.85

Wow, the [fulcrum.85](https://atelierkites.com/shop/en/fulcrum/51-fulcrum.html)! Super speedy, spinny and stoppy. Ace! Here it is in my customised colours.


#### Tarantula (2)

My own design using the colorizer I've made for Revolution.
