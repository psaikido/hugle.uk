Wedding magic at the beautiful [Stanton House
Hotel](http://www.stantonhouse.co.uk/). A very classic scene on the veranda of
the stately home with gorgeous views down the gardens to the lake. Some very
frisky bridesmaids made for a memorable performance. Very funny teenager
comments 'You're not as good as Dynamo' - ah bless! Tried a few new effects out
and got into trouble with one. Rescued it in the end. Luckily I'd built up
enough momentum for folks to think it was part of the act!  

I usually say that I don't do kid's shows but some friends asked me to do a
twenty minute show for a 5th birthday. Morgan is a 5th boy and so am I, they
are friends too so I said ok. It went really well I thought, it was the right
sort of length for this age range I thought and it was a lot of fun to do as
well - [pics](/pages/magic/pix.html).
