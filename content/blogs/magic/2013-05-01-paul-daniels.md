![Paul Daniels](/images/magic/paulDaniels.jpg)  Amazing day with the
grand old man of British magic. What a thrill it was. There were supposed to be
10 students but for unknown reasons 8 didn't show up. Just the 3 of us then!
Will expand on this at some point, but basically I didn't stop grinning for
days, it was very special and I learned an enormous amount from a very funny
and talented guy. Oh, and Debbie McGee was there briefly when I arrived, long
enough to offer drinks and snacks, what more could you want?
