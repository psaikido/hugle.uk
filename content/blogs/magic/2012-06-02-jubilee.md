Three days of intense activity left me really exhausted but very happy. 'Jodido
pero contento!' as the Spanish say. Getting a magic business off the ground I
figured I needed to get my card out there, to do lots of freeby shows and to
get the practice in. It is a long time since I worked in the circus so it was
important to get the 'air time' and get comfortable with the whole performance
thing.  

One thing that I found really uplifting was to see the pupils of spectator's
eyes dilate when the 'magic' happened. I can't get enough of that :) Their
whole nervous system goes ON and it's a little miracle to see a wave of joy go
through a person. Who wouldn't want that?
