title: Eastcott Christmas Party 
date: 2013-12-15

A flurry of activity as it gets on towards Christmas.
[Revolutions](http://www.revolution-bars.co.uk/bath), a vodka bar in Bath,
booked me. When I arrived I was nearly overwhelmed by the noise and the drunken
squadies reeling around. I pretended to stay cool but inside I was thinking 'oh
my God, I'm going to be torn apart by wild beasts'. Luckily the gig was
upstairs at a private party where they were a bit more sober. A few people fell
off chairs and there were a few goes at stealing my hat, but mainly I got that
fantastic moment when the pupils dilate. Can't get enough of that moment when
someone is truly astonished.  

The Eastcott Community Centre's Christmas party was great fun. Thanks to [Elmar
Rubio](http://www.elmarrubiophotography.co.uk/) for some sterling work!  

Many comments about my 'Heisenberg' hat. Due to the popularity of Breaking Bad,
my hat now looks like Walter White's rather than a homage to Buster
Keaton/Frank Sinatra.
