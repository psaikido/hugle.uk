The theory is that while spinning a quad kite the hands have to 'pump' to maintain the
angle of the plane of rotation. I had been visualising the bicycle spin technique based on
this idea that the plane of rotation has to be maintained. This here video was part of an
experiment to see if that's true. Looks like it worked to me

Oh, and then the camera fell over, which I thought looked quite funny..
