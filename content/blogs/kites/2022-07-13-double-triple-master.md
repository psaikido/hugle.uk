This is the flight that got me the 'Double Triple Master' title with Revolution
Club38. It's quite a bit like rhythmic gymnastics in that you have a set of
moves that you have to put together in your own way. There are a few things
I've put in outside of that - the zig-zag up to the top, a 'tumbleweed' but
upwards rather than side-to-side, and the ending where it does eight clock
turns as it descends, a little waggle and a final bow.
