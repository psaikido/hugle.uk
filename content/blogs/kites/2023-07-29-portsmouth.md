It was my first time out of my hometown in ages. Went by train which was much
less impact than driving. I have a chum who lives just 10 minutes from the site
and I stayed over with him. Meeting Joe in real life for the first time was
such a blast. We had a lot to talk about.  

His origin story about how he invented the quad-kite was that he had the idea
as he woke up from a dream saying "two wings!". Everything fell into place from
there. Up to that point he was trying to land a delta wing kite by attaching a
third line. Along with his brothers they were trying this for ages but
eventually gave up. Some months later he was blessed with inspiration upon
waking!
