Out flying with Mr G we noticed that we had a variation in our basic control and grip. It showed up clearest in an inverted hover so we filmed the two approaches to show to th club38 members for comments.  

In the first clip the thumbs provide forward pressure and the handles pivot around the forefinger.

In the second, my own style is that the pinkies provide backwards pressure and the handles pivot around the middle two fingers.

ymmv
