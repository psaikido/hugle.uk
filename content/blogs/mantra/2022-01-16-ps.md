![Padmasambhava4](/images/mani/padmasambhava/ps04.jpg)  Session #4. The second
letter 'ah' has the same radical as the 'om' before it but has a subscript
vowel mark too. Not sure why it needs that as radicals have an integral 'ah'
sound. More strange is it has two dots after it. I have asked about them and
apparently it's something to do with transcribing from Sanskrit! I used to
think they were a kind of repeat mark but not so. I've put some time into
learning the alphabet but can't claim to read or speak Tibetan. I could get by
in Ladakhi for a summer, but that was long ago now.
