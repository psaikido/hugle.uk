![mani 7](/images/mani/mani7.jpg)  

Made on retreat on Holy Island and presented to the monks living there. The
stone is granite I think and was hard enough to nearly destroy my Ladakhi
tools. The brown swirls in it were very attractive, the way there is a contrast
between their wispiness and the fact that it is stone.
