![mani 2](/images/mani/mani2Finished.jpg)  

Mani 2 completed in 22 hours over 9
days - here it is up against the wall of the main Gompa at Lamayuru - I'm told
it is still there 14 years later! Dupon Samten Rimpoche asked me to initial and
date them "to encourage the others", normally stones aren't signed
