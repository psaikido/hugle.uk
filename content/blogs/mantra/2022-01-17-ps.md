Session #5. About 2/3rds of the way through the initial pass. It looks like it
will need at least 3 passes. I'm going to guess that we'll have a count of
about 25 sessions by the end.  

The central bar of the 'dzra' ཛྲ disintegrated the moment I went near it! There
are pockets of unstable powder and also lumps of much harder and whiter
crystalline stuff to negotiate. I was worried that this much bigger stone would
be too heavy to work with in the way I've learned but it's proving just about
do-able. 

The ME situation is that there is usually a 'post exertional malaise' after
activity. Today's recovery from the session was unusually long - zonked for
around 2 hours. Might have to shorten the sessions to sustain the work.
