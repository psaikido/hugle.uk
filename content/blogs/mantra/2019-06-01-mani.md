I chose this one because of how beautifully flat it is and its colours and diagonal grain.

It is made of [Upper Old Red Sandstone](http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Upper_Old_Red_Sandstone,_Bristol_and_Gloucester_region).  

![Portishead Beach](/images/mani/mani10/beach.jpg)  

Redcliffe bay looking towards Battery Point. This is where I found a really
lovely stone. The date is approximate, I think it was in the summer of 2019
ish.
