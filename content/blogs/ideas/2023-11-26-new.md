Back in 1379 someone decided to call their 'new' college in Oxford ['New College'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College,_Oxford).

It probably seemed like a good idea at the time.

['New York'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) was named in 1664! Before that it was called ['New Amsterdam'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam).

Then there is [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) named
such in the mid 1600s. To my mind the Maori name
[Aotearoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa) is so much cooler.

The wondrous fork of vim has been dubbed
['neovim'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). It's a cool name but 'neo' &
'new' suffers the same short-sightedness as 'New College'. Perhaps 'luavim'
would've been more accurate, more fitting and longer lasting.

I've seen servers set up and called 'new_server'.

Isn't it like naming a child 'Junior'? 80 years later it doesn't look like such
a great idea.

Naming things can be hard. You've probably been in discussions about what to
call a band, magazine, business, child, dog or nearly anything. There are so
many angles to consider it seems like a simple shortcut to call it 'new'
something.

Depending on how important a thing is likely to be, it would be good to spend a
fitting amount of time and consideration to come up with a better name. It
looks bad in the long run when the context of a thing has been ignored doesn't
it!? It can look like laziness (New College), colonialism (New Zealand) or
short sightedness (neovim).

This blog post is called 'new'!
