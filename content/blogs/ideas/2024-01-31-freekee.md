### Let us seize the means of computation!

We've had qwerty for a veeery long time

We have tons of amazing innovations in keyboards - see the [voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/), [keebmaker](https://keebmaker.com/) or the [gergoplex](https://golem.hu/board/GergoPlex-370.html)

Then there are game controllers

Lets make a typing interface that combines the best of a gaming controller with
a minimalist, ergonomic, split keyboard!

## FREEKEE

- more ergonomic with palms facing in
- combines mouse/track pad
- customisable with [zmk](https://zmk.dev/) and [qmk](https://qmk.fm/keyboards/) 
- type in VR
- on the couch
- in space
- connect to laptops
- desktops
- smart devices
- you don't have to sit at a desk

There are ready made offerings like
[grabshell](https://grabshell.site/en/home-en/) and
[alphagrip](https://www.alphagrip.com/) but the linux support is poor or not
there and you basically get what you're given.

A game controller's motion capabilities for point and
click can be used as a mouse or track pad. We could use one of [these](https://www.cirque.com/glidepoint-circle-trackpads)

The position is better than a traditional, palm down style, which is designed
to be used with a device sitting on a desk. The gaming controller has the palms
facing the belly which is a much more natural orientation. 

The old qwerty days can be left behind, we already have lots of better ways.
There's dvorak, colemak and my fav
[halmak](https://youtu.be/pZ40gmfDFfQ?si=7X_xxLtkxtkSrC0p) for example. Program
your own 'just exactly right' keyboard/controller! Let's call the project
'freekey' and opensource everything.
