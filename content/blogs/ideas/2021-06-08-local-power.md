Neighbourhoods could band together for food and power. Rather than each for themselves and a monthly bill to a big utility provider, there could be communal allotments and wind/sun/bio generators just for a dozen houses or so. Wouldn't that be an efficient way to have power and food? It would probably end up being a mixture of the big utility provider model and a local provision model. Supermarkets and shops as now, but much more backed up by subsistence farming like what made Britain so resilient during the second world war. We've lost so much of that self-reliance. I don't know how to look after chickens, grow spuds and all that. Why? What other needs could be met, if only partially, by local and communal efforts?
