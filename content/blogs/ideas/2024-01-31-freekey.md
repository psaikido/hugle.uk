Lets make a typing interface that combines the best of a gaming controller with
a minimalist, ergonomic, split keyboard!

The tech is there to use its motion capabilities for point and click so it is a
mouse or track pad.

See the [https://golem.hu/board/GergoPlex-370.html](gergoplex) or [keebmaker](https://keebmaker.com/).

The position is better than a traditional, palm down style designed to be used
with a device sitting on a desk. The gaming controller has the palms facing the
belly which is a much more natural orientation. The old qwerty days can be left
behind, we already have lots of better ways. There's dvorak, colemak and my fav
halmak for example. Program your own 'just exactly right' keyboard/controller!
Let's call the project 'freekey' and opensource everything so that the big
vendors don't end up controlling it all (again).
