Took the Tara stone to the [Palpung centre](http://palpung.org.uk/) in Brynmawr, Wales, met Lama Rabsang and Sophie there so that the stones could be given to them. Lama seemed pleased with the stone and it has been added to the shrine

Here's the whole amazing shrine room with the table above seen on the right

Will have to wait to see where Sophie's mani stone finds a home..
