Make a start on toe-up socks on magic loop. They will be a pressie for someone
with size 6 feet, UK. That's US size 8 according to
[this](https://www.shoesizingcharts.com/) converter. This conversion is needed
in order to use [these](https://www.goodknitkisses.com/sock-sizes-chart/)
charts to get the foot circumference. It works out at 21.6cm.

The yarn I have for them is Stylecraft's 'Recreate' recycled yarn. I have the
colours:

'Ink' (dark grey)

The toe up way of doing it is what I'll try first.  
I follow tutorials on youtube:

Some notes here so that I can make the 2nd sock the same as the first.
- cast on 12 on both needles to make 24
- - magic cat's cradle type technique, see vids
- increase 1 on each end of both needles
- - actually 1 in from each end
- alternate with a plain row
- keep going until there are 48 stitches
