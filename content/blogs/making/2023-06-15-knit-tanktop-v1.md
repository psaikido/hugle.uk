Knitted test for a tanktop/vest pattern.  
This will eventually be for Griff.  
This is based on [Kitty's Vest](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/kittys-vest)  
The pattern is for very different yarn and needles so the head hole has come out tiny :)  
Made I larf!  
The idea was to practice all the stitches, increases, decreases etc, and how to do the v neck.
