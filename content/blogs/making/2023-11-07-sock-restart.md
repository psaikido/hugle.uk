![socks #2](/images/stuff/socks-2.jpg)

Things got weird around the heel. 

Somehow I had a pearl row standing out and so I ripped out a bunch of rows to
redo them. Rethreading the needles got messy and so I reviewed:

- There are some holes and ladders. 
- Second grey stripe too wide.

Dang! First try is an experiment.
