![socks #3](/images/stuff/socks-3.jpg)
{.img-half}

Well, I finished, but, ah, it's a bit different from what I expected! There's
way too much instep so I'll have to reduce that next time. This one will be an
"experiment". Will try again with different stitch counts. Will reduce before
doing the ribbing too. It's "charmingly home made"!?
