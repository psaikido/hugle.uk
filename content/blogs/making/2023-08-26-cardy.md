Bought a pattern from the wonderful [Spinning Weal](https://spinningweal.co.uk/) in Clevedon.

Second knitted garment and a dry run for my mam's jumper. The idea was to see
if I could follow a pattern and make all the mistakes on an experiment.

They no longer had the exact right yarn so I got a close enough type from King
Cole called 'New Orleans'. It's cleverly dyed such that it looks like Fair Isle
or something.

It took 8 weeks to complete.

If you compare the pattern to this last picture, I don't want to hear about it ;)
