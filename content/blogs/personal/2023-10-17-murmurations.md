The [murmurations](https://www.murmurations.life/) project had its ending event at
Bristol's Watershed on Oct 17th 2023.

Through the University of Bristol's [Connecting Through Culture as we
Age](https://connectingthroughcultureasweage.info/) organisation, I was invited to
be a 'co-researcher' on a sub-project initially called 'A Dictionary of Missing
Words'. This was through the fabulous [Unchartered
Collective](https://uncharteredcollective.com/new-page) which is all about
invisible disability.

I had written two poems for it [dictionary](/hk/bucket/dictionary/) and
[olympus](/hk/bucket/olympus/). A special blanket was made that had the symbols
we made stitched on. They could be pressed and you'd get an audio of people
talking about that thing. A smaller version was made so that house-bound people
could experience it too.

For me the work centred around the term 'exulansis'.

[exulansis](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/96261999250/exulansis)
n. _the tendency to give up trying to talk about an experience because people
are unable to relate to it—whether through envy or pity or simple
foreignness—which allows it to drift away from the rest of your life story,
until the memory itself feels out of place, almost mythical, wandering
restlessly in the fog, no longer even looking for a place to land._

This word and the project brought together various strands about Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder and living with [me/cfs](/blogs/essays/2023-08-28-mecfs/).
Hearing other's experiences and difficulties in other, parralel situations was
amazing and interesting. I learned a lot from it and got myself updated a bit
about things I'd not thought much about before, like how it is to live with
neuro-divergence, with queerness or as a non-binary person. 

Overall I felt that getting some official recognition as a poet, as an older
person and someone with me/cfs was wonderfully affirming and lent me some
legitimacy. 

There are some really great people working in this area. I thank them!
