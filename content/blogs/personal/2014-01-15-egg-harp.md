My first musical instrument, the 'egg harp'

They had it on [Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03s6mm7) (59:00)

So, when I was really little, amongst my earliest memories, I used to hypnotise
myself with my mam's wee 'egg harp', playing it's tiny strings and listening to
it's strangeness. PM, the radio4 show, have a thing where listeners send in odd
little sounds, so I sent in a recording of the eggharp. I had recorded it at
Christmas to use as a ringtone on my phone.
