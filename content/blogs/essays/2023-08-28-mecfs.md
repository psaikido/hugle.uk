'me/cfs' is a glob of 'ME' Myalgic Encephalopathy aka 'CFS' Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome. All terms contested as is everything to do with the condition.  

I was diagnosed with it in 2000 but had been ill since an accident in 1991. My
situation is currently classified as 'Moderate'.  

As it says in the NICE document below "Recognise that people with ME/CFS may
have experienced prejudice and disbelief and could feel stigmatised by people
(including family, friends, health and social care professionals, and teachers)
who do not understand their illness." It's my experience after losing jobs,
housing and relationships that people's negative attitudes to this condition
really add to its burden. I'm hoping that the info below might do something to
ease that unnecessary situation and lead to a bit more support. 

This here is a listing of relevant info.
