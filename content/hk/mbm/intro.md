A Buddhist pilrimage undergone in 2005/6. The writing in prose form
about that journey is called
[Pilgrimage](/prose/pilgrimage/010-leaving/). The printed form of
these poems are the second part of the little book [Sunshine &
Shadow](/hk/sun/intro/).

"Hughie Carroll gives himself to his life so wholeheartedly that the
reader fears for him, exposed to raw pain, then flooded with love.
He has a remarkable degree of openness, and is able to articulate
for us the hard won wisdom of the feeling person, an Everyman who
will try anything and loves a laugh, 'delighted at the nonsense of
it all'. Life is gloriously absurd, and we are all 'preposterous
jewels, awkward miracles'.  Hughie records his experience in
autobiographical poetic anecdotes that are always frank, and often
funny." - George Marsh
