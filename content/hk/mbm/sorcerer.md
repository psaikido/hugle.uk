the abbot at Lamayuru  
really loved my magic tricks  
they called it 'jadu'  
a Hindi borrow word  
it became my nickname  
for a month or two


one day he asked me  
to show them to an old yogin  
who had been on retreat  
a group of elite monks gathered  
as I twiddled with a lighter  
some elastic bands  
and general foolishness  
with sleight of hand  
the old man stepped back  
and lifted his hand towards me  
and started chanting in Tibetan


somewhat confused  
I did another trick  
and the abbot made a comment  
in Ladakhi  
I didn't understand  
but the old man suddenly stopped  
and then everyone roared with laughter  
the monks doubled over  
pulling each other around  
their tears rolled down their  
nut brown  
creased faces  
maroon robes  
dotted dark  


at last the abbot told me  
"he thought you were a sorcerer  
and was doing the 'quelling magic' mantra  
because you did another trick  
I told him that your jadu  
was stronger than his mantra"  


later he asked me to teach him  
"this magic makes people happy  
come to my room after lights out  
and show me"  
so I said "I'll teach you my secrets  
if you teach me yours!"  
again the laughter  
I don't think you are supposed  
to talk to rinpoches  
that way  
but I went to his room  
late at night  
and showed him everything  
at one point  
we both rolled on our backs  
our feet in the air  
holding on to our stomachs


delighted


at the nonsense of it all
