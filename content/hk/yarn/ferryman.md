the human body  
is not supposed to survive  
a twenty seven foot fall  
onto the back  
on a hard surface  
so the consultant said  


"you should break the skull  
and the spine and rupture  
the internal organs  
that none of these three things  
have happened  
I frankly have no explanation for  
young man!"  


he looked sharply over  
half moon glasses  
he wore a three piece suit  
and I think belonged  
in the 1950s  


so if I shake or cry  
or need yet another nap  
don't think  
"there's something wrong with him"  


because there isn't  


it's just the fare for the ferryman  
to bring me back across  
just what Mother Nature needs  
in return  
for my life
