how hard is it  
to make a music video?  
I was thinking  
doing an experiment  
stepping very slowly  
meditatively  
towards the main drag  
holding my phone  
up by my chest


I'd speed it up  
so the walking was normal  
everyone else very fast


if I hadn't stopped filming  
I could've shown you  
the woman running up  
the red face  
the spit flying out  
the jabbing finger  
the volume


"IT'S ILLEGAL TO FILM CHILDREN!"  
she shrieked  
I looked around  
but saw no one  
turning back  
I said "wh?"  
but she was off again


"YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!"  
"IT'S DISGRACEFUL!"  
and so forth  
she power marched away  
I fled into a shop  
to buy a sandwich  
and to wait for my heart   
to slow down


as I got back  
to where I was working  
I heard a banging on windows  
there she was again  
on a passing bus  
accusing finger  
pointing right at me  
surrounded by a mob of blokes  
lots of tattoos  
not much hair


happy shoppers  
become  
lynch mob
