floundering through the labyrinth  
the hostile environment  
after months  
the benefits interview  
arrived  


the lady was nice enough  
but the grilling  
was gruelling  
my disabilities laid bare  


each question  
uncovering  
exposing  
unpleasant truths  


my brave face slipped off  
as I left  
rain lashed down  
diagonal drenching  
the nadir  
all mixed  
with tears


a hollow laugh  
at the cliche
