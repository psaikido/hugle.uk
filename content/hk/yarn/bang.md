weedkiller and sugar  
burned with a supernatural light  
a fierce lancing  
to the eyes  
utterly  
fascinating  


my brother packed it  
into a big glass jar  
and made a fuse  
out of string  


in the lee of a fallen log  
I lit that string  
the flame wouldn't blow out  
to smoulder slowly  
but instead raced along  
my eleven year old face  
inches away


turning to run  
at the last second  
I remember wheeling  
off my feet  
the glass hitting my back  
whistling past my ears  
I was most impressed  
that I could briefly make out  
a me shaped hole  
in the blasting debris  


lying on my back  
listening to a very high note  
my brother called my name


distantly
