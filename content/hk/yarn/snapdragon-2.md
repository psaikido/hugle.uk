rehearsals  
Sowerby Bridge  
13th April 1991  


we were speeding up the stunt  
that had been going so well  
the whole year before  
me on the stage  
hands in straps  
rope up to a pulley  
across to a second pulley  
and down to two people  
high up in the netting  
when they jumped  
I would fly up fast  
the audience would freak  
as I hit the roof
above their heads


my mate's feet were hurting  
from hitting the ground  
the rope was shortened  
no one thought it through  
he would now take the weight  
on his hands  
so down he went  
his hands pulled free  
I no longer had  
a counter balance  


I hit the rigging bar  
way too hard  
everything much too fast  
my body went horizontal  
and then time went weird  
dilated  
looking at my clothes  
all blue with red bumper boots  
seemed to go on and on  
just hanging there  
all weightless  
and utterly certain  
that nothing in this world  
was going to stop me falling  
all the way way down  
to that hard hard stage


next thing I saw myself  
from over on the empty seating  
long enough to think both  
"oh, so that's what I look like"  
and  
"what the FUCK am I doing over here?"  


then


the abyss


no light anywhere  
no stars  
no world  
no body  
just a point of consciousness  
in an infinite void  
I don't have the language  
to get it across  
words like "terror" and "fear"  
just point in the right direction  
and that was only the start  


after a while it became clear  
that if I went to my right  
I would re-enter my body  
that was where all the pain was  
so I didn't want to do that  
then if I went to my left  
I would never again  
be back inside my body  
and just stay in that void  
alone forever  


you can't die if you have no body


it felt like maybe twenty minutes  
I floated in that dread  
until I thought my point of awareness  
would fly apart with stress  
an arm came around me  
"come with me Hughie, it's ok"  
and it wizzed me  
through immense distances  
at bewildering speed  
and put me  
exquisitely gently  
back inside my body  
between my shoulder blades  
the single most painful moment  
of my life
