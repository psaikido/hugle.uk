the taxi driver  
kept taking me to shops  
carpets, suits, jewellery  
all over Chennai  
it got boring  


one place had a glass case  
with bright lights  
and incredible sapphires  
I asked to see one  


the guy unlocked it  
and took out a cushion  
with the biggest glittery rock  
I'd ever seen  
a blue that sliced  
and thrilled


he handed it to me  
I took it  
my hand forming the starting position  
for the 'French Drop'  
the simplest sleight of hand  
and 'boff' it was gone  
I couldn't help it  


reaching over  
I pulled it out of his ear  
and gave it back  
but he'd already pressed the alarm  


two big heavies  
materialised out of thin air  
like genies  
and frog marched me out  
laughing  
helplessly  


me  
not them
