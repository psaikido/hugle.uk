<div class="poem">
my endarkenment was total  
an absence of light  
and also of matter  
both internal and external  

bodiless

I hung suspended  
in an infinite abyss


decades later  
the dread of it  
still clings about me  
but that experience  
was actually a defence  
the brainstem functioning  
to protect me  
from the savage reality  
of the impact of the fall


just like a nightmare  
recalled in the daytime  
it can still give a jolt  
but it can be known  
as a strangeness  
an illusion  
unreal  
something from the beyond


so when my nervous system  
goes into the old trauma  
and everything is demanding  
to bolt like a horse  
again and again  
I must reassure myself  
that it's all a false alarm  
that really there is no crisis  
that the past really has gone  
and in the present    
I am safe  
that the universe does want me  
the proof of which  
is that right now


I am here
