<div class="poem">
I had asked him  
not to leave  
his liturgy on the floor  
that's what we called  
the sheets of A4  
that had our Dharma words  
the things to say and chant  
at the start and the end  
of our weekly meditation group    
he had come for years  
but very on and off  
spending months or longer  
seriously on the piss


he busked the guitar in town  
and was borderline homeless  
when he was sober  
he would go back to running  
he had represented his county  
at hurdles I think it was  


something about my request  
made him proper crazy  
he jumped to his feet  
and thrust his face into mine  
"it's only a piece of paper"  
he barked  
as he flapped it hard  
on the ground once more


I don't recall my response  
probably tried to be diplomatic  
what I do recall is the obituary  
a few years later  
he had chucked himself  
under a train  


it said he had six times  
the normally fatal dose  
of alcohol in his blood  
at the time  


I feel sure the two are related  
the disrespect and the death  
but somehow it now feels wrong  
even to speculate  
except to say  
I now feel  
the meaning of the words  
is in the manner of their handling
