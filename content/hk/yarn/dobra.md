Nick had told me  
about the Dobra Valley  
how no one had ever gone down it  
and come out alive  
how he had tried by himself  
a few years previously  
how close he'd come  
to starving  
during an epic escape  
he needed a chum  
so down we went


we had ropes  
supplies  
training  
but the first big challenge  
was a waterfall  
way taller than our ropes  
we picked our way  
down the side  
hundreds of metres  
of scree  
one false move  
and pfft  


after that we were committed  
neither of us imagining  
we could go back up  
so on we went  
after some nosh  
and bravado  


the valley narrowed  
there was time  
for photos  
so we thought  
but the river dissappeared  
around a bend  
between vertical walls  


it was hard to choose  
but we swam  


stupid


the rucksac took me under  
should've taken it off  
there was not enough strength  
to get back to the surface  
as my breath  gave out  
he hauled me up  
by the scruff of the neck  
and there I was  
worrying about another waterfall  
beyond that bend  


both of us scared  
and exhausted  
we forced our way on  
down a broadening valley  
at one point seeing  
human footprints  
our eyes always craning upwards  
for any possible escape  
the sun dipped low  
  

the walls narrowed again  
water quicker  
blacker  
another bend  
we both knew  
we were not going to make it  
not this time  


we backtracked  
feeling desperate  
but there  
in the failing light  
we saw a barn  
way up high  
that had to be an escape  


forcing through brambles  
heaving steep and loose  
scrabbling up moss  
it was night  
by the time we flopped  
over a little wall  
into a meadow  
we laughed and cried  
with relief  
the little cabana  
would have a loft  
full of straw  
we could sleep in  


a bull


yes a bull  
came to have a look  
it pawed the ground  
tossing its head  
just like a cartoon  
my last bit of adrenaline  
sped my wobbling legs  
over to the barn  


I looked back  
to see how Nick was getting on  
he sat where I left him  
the bull bellowed  
but Nick bellowed back  


"FUCK


OFF!"  


to my astonishment  
it did


after a night of space-blankets  
shivering  
dehydration  
blood-loss  
and straw beasts  
nibbling at us  
we hitched back to our base  
the local Guardia Civil  
were surprised to see us  
having told everyone  
that the last two people  
to give it a go  
had never returned
