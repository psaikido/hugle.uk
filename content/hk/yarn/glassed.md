they both weighed  
twice as much as me  
my rugby mates  
I was tough and wiry  
but weedy by comparison  
we threw the ball about  
and each other  
until we were sufficiently  
muddied  
and our clothes  
adequately ripped

having worked up a thirst  
we ran off to the pub  
to further compete  
in a royal quaffing  
at some point  
deep in the ale  
one took aim at his head  
with an empty pint glass   
"one, two" SMASH!  
it looked for all the world  
like he really had  
glassed himself  
he had let it go  
between "two" and SMASH  
it had really just  
broken on the floor  

the other guy  
was also convinced  
so he gave it a go  
somehow by chance  
he only nicked himself  
glass all down his chest  

"Wow!" thought I  
"I didn't know you could do that!"  
so "one, two" SMASH!  
and I had severed  
two arteries in my forehead  
as I stood up  
I saw two beautiful red jets  
spurting  
right out in front of me  
quickly I was blinded  
I grabbed someone  
and got them to lead me  
outside where they  
picked out the glass  
I lay my head against a wall  
and they pressed against the cuts

the ambulance and the police  
arrived pretty soon  
a copper rugby tackled  
my friend  
the one stopping the bleeding  
an ambulance man  
started berating the policeman  
as people streamed  
out of the pub  
an old nurse took me  
by the elbow  
and quietly lead me  
into an ambulance

dabbing away the blood  
just enough to see  
I thought I made out  
two people locked in combat  
rolling out into the road  
it had turned  
from a fracas  
into carnage  
as we zipped off  
to the hospital

they stitched me up  
no anaesthetic  
and left me  
to sleep it off  
at some point in the night  
there was an accident  
with a bed pan  
which was already full

they let me out in the morning  
and I stumbled through the rain  
an old lady flattened herself  
against a wall  
to let me past  
looking horrified

I glanced at my reflection  
in the window of a bustop  
covered in piss, blood and mud  
clothes tattered  
two black eyes  
and wires  
sticking out of my head  
I looked quite a bit  
like Frankenstein's monster
