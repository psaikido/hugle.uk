flying my blue motorbike  
over that big old bridge to Wales  
into an enfoldment of mist  


nearly blind  
I slowed to a near stall  


over the hump  
descending  
a lorry came up behind  
flashing lights  
honking


lifting the helmet's visor  
I saw that the cloud  
was left behind  
except for a little bubble  
all mine
