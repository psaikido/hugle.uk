Finchley Fair had asked  
for a contribution from the circus  
so a bunch of us piled in a van  
we were only down the road  

that morning a Minister   
after an anti-German rant  
had been forced to resign

guessing the iron lady  
might put in an appearance  
Finchley being Thatcher's constituency  
we learned the tune  
to the beautiful old hymn  
"Deutschland Deutschland  
uber alles"  
they changed the words now

I was on trumpet  
and could only just about  
hold the tune  
the sax and trombone  
were real proper pros  
and did all the glorious harmonies  

when we got there  
dotted about  
were heavy set guys in suits  
with earpieces  
sharp haircuts  
and bulges under their arms  
"Thatcher's coming isn't she?"  
but they wouldn't answer

ten minutes later  
suddenly there she was  
a surreal pantomime dame  
she rocketed around in a circuit  
surrounded by heavies  
so  
1, 2, 3, 4  
we played the tune

a local guy leaned over  
and bonked the end of my trumpet  
loosening my front teeth  
moments later she was gone  

the Sun reporter was beside himself  
delirious with joy  
hopping from foot to foot  
he took our details  
and sure enough  
the next day  
in that apalling rag  
"Red Faces in the Park"  
a tiny article appeared  
"Cheeky clowns  
embarrassed the premier  
after Ridley's resignation"  

a bruised lip  
was a very small price  
for such a deep satisfaction
