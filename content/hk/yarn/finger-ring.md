<div class="poem">
wedding gig  
doing magic  
for the bridesmaids  


"this is a finger ring  
good isn't it!?  
do you like that?  
everyone likes  
a good finger ring  
don't they?!"  


the kind of naughty line  
that has to be handled carefully  


on this occasion  
a guy was about to swallow  
a mouthful of champagne  
and managed to snort it  


we all watched  
transfixed  
as he heroically struggled  
to not let it  
explode out of his nose  


when at last he swallowed  
tears down his cheeks  
everyone jumped to their feet  
for a standing ovation
