a tweet offered a place  
a Paul Daniels Master Class  
twelve would-be magicians  
to spend a day  
at his house  
I answered and got it  
the last place  
the last minute  


he answered the door  
a beautiful house  
near a village  
called Wargrave  
I looked down  
he really was  
that small  
  

Debbie McGee made coffee  
I was filled with a sense  
of the surreal  
we waited for the others  
with a tongue tied guy  
paralysed with nerves


they rang to say  
they had broken down  
so the three of us  
started without them  
they never did  
show up  


before she left us  
Debbie warned us  
he could talk forever  
when we had had enough  
we had to say so  


there were two big white rabbits  
in an enormous cage  
and bizarre magical paraphernalia  
in every corner  


in the toilet there were photos  
of the great man posing  
with all the political figures  
I detested  


he started with all business  
how to make a living  
all the tricks  
of making money  
he told us of his poverty  
claiming he was eleven  
when he saw his first tree  
the industrial North East  
sounded like Mordor  
it started to make sense  
his allegiance  
to those who charm and trick  
so the rich get richer  
bugger the rest


he was hilarious  
and brilliant  
amazing us  
every few minutes  
our silent partner  
leaving the conversation  
to just me  
and the grandee  


there was an endless stream  
of incredible anecdotes  
he had known  
anyone famous  
for over fifty years  
my favourite  
was about the Prince of Dubai  
who he had entertained  
without props or preparation  
when the hired magician  
another famous name  
had managed to offend  
Paul had disappeared  
everything off the banquet table  
piece  
by piece  


after the third racist joke  
1970s style  
and vile  
he said  
"you can't tell jokes like that anymore"  
I said  
"there's a reason for that Paul"  
there was a frosty silence  
but he forgave me  
and pointed towards his neighbour's house  
around the bend of the river  
it belonged to the spoon bender  
Uri Geller  
Paul said the river  
used to be straight  


he challenged me  
to vanish something  
I used his own method  
slightly ashamed  
to ingratiate  


he gave up his secrets  
in such a sweet way  
I could tell that he liked me  
he told a story  
of someone offering hundreds of pounds  
waving the cash around  
for a trick  
but he didn't give it up  
because he didn't like him  
he then went on to show me  
I felt blessed


at one point I asked him  
about the Mrs Merton joke  
she had asked Debbie McGee  
"what first attracted you  
to millionaire Paul Daniels?"  
a crack that has lasted  
the one everyone seems to remember  
he was clearly wounded  
and said that the irony  
was that it was Debbie  
who was the rich one  
when they first met  
  

some months later  
we went to his show  
at the Wyvern Theatre  
at the meet and greet  
afterwards  
he recognised me  
we smiled  
so complicated  
that acknowledgement  
I liked him  
not a lot  
but I liked him


it was among  
his last few shows  
shortly afterwards  
he disappeared
