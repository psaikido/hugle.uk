we had been climbing  
all day long  
the wind at the top  
was steady  
as a rock  


the routes were shortish  
I spent a fair amount of time  
bringing in the ropes  
leaning on that wind  
so strong  


right at the last  
before going home  
we went to look over  
and say goodbye  


the angle we stood at  
put the eyes level with the rim  
and the feet about  
a foot back  
appropriately enough  


I don't know what possessed me  
but I inched forward  
so the toes  
got to the lip  
the eyes looked back  
onto the headwall  


nearer to flight  
I couldn't get  
a snatched moment  
delirious  
eternal  


oh but you could lean  
on that wind  


was it an act of faith  
or tempting fate?
