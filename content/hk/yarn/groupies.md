two girls in the audience  
had clearly taken a shine  
I played my funky guitar  
and tried not to make  
eye contact  


they seemed enormous  
and looked sweaty  
something about  
their eagerness  
and bulk  
made me want to run  


they waited around  
while the band packed up  
and I hid  
waiting for an opportunity  
to bolt  


they weren't giving up  
and the last of our gear  
was about to go  


it is a two person job  
carrying a bass cabinet  
I scooted down behind it  
and scuttled along  
hoping they wouldn't  
see my feet
