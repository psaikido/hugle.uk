outside the Chan hall  
at Gaumin Si  
we discussed and stretched  
after De Lin's Dharma talk  
I told John I thought  
one of the best bits  
was when he said  
"the silence of silent illumination  
is not the silence of no thoughts  
it's the silence of no reaction"  
John poked me in the forehead

"don't

you

forget it!"
