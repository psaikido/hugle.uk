the only band on the island  
2 Hot 4 July  
we had a special gig  
in the ancient Greek amphitheatre  

I was furious with the leader  
he hadn't paid us tuppence  
all his promises  
like his Jamaican accent  
turned out to be fake  

my song was Psycho Killer  
when I took the main mic  
for the guitar solo  
I made like Jimi Hendrix  
leaving the thing  
on the stage  
with broken strings  
and feedback screaming  
the starry vault above  
torn in half  
by the ecstatic howl

afterwards a man came up  
he claimed to have signed Madonna  
he asked me to send him a tape  
but I had no songs of my own  
and somehow lost his address
