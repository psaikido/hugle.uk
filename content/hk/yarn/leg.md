one snowy Christmas  
the whole family went  
to the woods  
I had a wrestle  
with my brother  
both of us  
middle-aged  
it seemed the perfect opportunity  
to spring some jiu-jitsu  
I waited for him to push  
and spun around  
for a hip throw  
the inner edge of my boot  
had caught in the snow  
leaving my foot behind  
pop pop  
and my leg was broke  
dad drove me to the hospital  
there was a long wait  
he leaned over to whisper  
see that guy?  
he's come in  
to have his tie  
straightened
