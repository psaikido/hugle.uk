<div class="poem">
the clowing workshop  
could really get rough  
away for a week  
with some scary genius  
at one point  
we had to go on stage  
for a timed three minutes  
we were not allowed  
to move or speak


at first there was panic  
self-consciousness at its worst  
it felt like something pressing  
hard up against my face  
a thing I had been avoiding  
for as long as I could remember  


the thing is  
anxiety can only go so high  
and then it can't maintain itself  
and naturally begins to drop  
the pressure eased off  
I noticed someone in the audience  
and they noticed me  
noticing them  
for some reason it was funny  
and people began to giggle  
pretty soon it was riotous  
I'm still not really sure  
just what was so funny  
but my God, funny it was!  


my three minutes was up  
I felt like a king  
never again did stage fright  
come to spoil the party
