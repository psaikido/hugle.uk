there is a levitation trick  
we're not supposed to tell  
how it's done  
like most magic  
the secret  
is disappointing  


returning from the bathroom  
to my brand new girlfriend's  
bedroom  
it was all bedecked  
with candles  


with not a stitch on  
I realised  
the setting was perfect  
so I went into character  
walked very slowly  
seriously  
silently  
to the end of the bed  


in a solemn gesture  
of finger to lips  
I asked for her quiet  
and total attention  


after a dramatic pause  
I lifted  
a handswidth  
off the floor  
and floated  
for an impossible  
heartbeat  


I managed to keep the mood  
dead serious  
as I took both her hands  
in mine  
and gazing into  
her big round eyes  
made her promise  
breathlessly  
that she would never tell  
a living soul  
what exactly  
she had just witnessed  


never good at deadpan  
I must've laughed  
for half an hour  


so if you can keep  
a secret  
well  


so can I
