the book had the title  
"Speed Reading"  
in big bold letters on the cover  
I slid it across the desk  


the librarian was large  
an example of what  
used to be called  
"matronly"  


she went through the rigmarole  
of cards and ink and stamps  
thonk! thonk!  
and slid it back


I riffled the pages with my thumb  
thrrrrip!  
and sliding it back once more  
said "thanks very much"


she froze in her clumpy shoes  
and gave me a look  
Lucifer himself  
would have been impressed  
a look of winter  
of savage contempt  
of something beyond the grave  


I felt that dreadful gaze on my back  
as I speedily withdrew  
my giggles forced down into silence  

back outside  
I think my laughter bursting out  
was accompanied  
by a tiny drop  
of wee
