I am  
the under geek  
no longer cracking the whip  
technologies befuddled me  
the labyrinth wins and I'm lost  
battling to move into brainy spaces  
after such a physical youth  
perhaps it's time  
to let the machines win  
and do what I do best  

to listen to birds  
to hold the impossible scale  
of all the suffering  
inside my chest  
to just allow   
all the death struggles  
to continue their dying
