These pieces were mostly written from 2019.  I couldn't think of a title at the
beginning so I was just chucking them into a directory I called 'bucket'.
Eventually it morphed into 'finger writing' from one of the pieces. This was
prompted by the fact that I couldn't find a satisfying image to go with
'bucket'!

A majority of the poems formed in the early hours of the morning. I'd wake
up and get it down and then do a bit of tidying after. If it didnt' have the
feeling of coming out of the unconscious somehow, then I'd usually not continue
with it. It seems that processes I'm not aware of are going on in the
background for some time before they come up and kind of demand to be written
down. There is a visceral sense of completion and 'aha!' and if that happens,
then it's in!
