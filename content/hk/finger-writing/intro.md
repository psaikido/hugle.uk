The title poem ['Finger Writing'](/finger-writing/finger-writing/) comes from the symbol
of water vapour condensing into droplets when it meets a plate of cold glass
which is quite a bit like the process of writing. Amorphous ideas, emotions,
sentiments, ‘condense’ into ink marks on the surface of the page or screen. In
addition, when you write on a steamed up window pane with your finger you are
usually pointing, quite literally, at your own reflection. How pleasing for an
image to speak so eloquently! We see ourselves reflected in our attempts at
self-expression. Half seen, half remembered fragments swimming about in the
unconscious come up and make themselves known.

There are the usual anecdotes, some jokes, philosophising and musing, but all
the pieces are ‘waited for’ rather than forced. I’ve been trying to avoid
deliberately poetic devices in the main, they are added here and there
admittedly, but overall I’ve waited and listened to the unconscious as far as
I’m able and eventually something comes up.
