<div class="latin">

argument and counter-argument  
all night long  
the philosophers debated  
locking horns over free will  
wrestling  
about karma  

after every hair was split  
at last the morning came  
and so  
tired out  
and none the wiser  
the unstoppable force  
and the immovable object  
got up and left  

which shoe each of them  
put on first?  

that was free will  

the second?  

karma
