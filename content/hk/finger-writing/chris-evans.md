<div class="latin">

whose name did I write?  

now, I don't think I looked    
anything like him  
Chris Evans that is  
him who married Billie Piper  
the singer from Swindon  

back in the mid 90s  
it seemed like you would see  
his gingery hair  
and thick-rimmed NHS glasses  
every time you turned on a TV  

this was back before the internet  
imagine that!  
back when if you wanted  
to watch a film at home  
you'd have to hire a VHS video  

and so it was  
that me and my then girlfriend  
went to a Blockbusters  
in Gorse Hill  
to get a copy of True Lies  
or was it Pulp Fiction?  
anyway  
that detail got drowned out  
by what happened next  

on our way in  
some youths on a bench  
noticed my characteristics  
the gingery hair  
the thick-rimmed NHS glasses  
and called out 'Chris Evans'  
they all laughed  
I rolled my eyes  
and tutted  

in the shop  
while we were browsing  
there was some banging  
on the window  
which I ignored  
but by the time we came out  
a reasonable sized crowd  
had formed outside

a bunch of people rushed at us  
multiple voices lifted  
'Chris Evans'  
'Chris Evans'  

I couldn't raise my eyebrows  
any higher  
when someone thrust out  
a paper and pen  
and asked for an autograph

nearly thirty years later  
I honestly can't remember  
whose name  
I wrote
