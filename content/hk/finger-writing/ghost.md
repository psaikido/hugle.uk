<div class="latin">

the death was years ago  
my God how long has it been?  
decades anyway  
I don't know  
when the anniversary comes around  
i get increasingly tense  
in the few weeks before  
and often wonder  
why i can't remember  
the funeral  
  
so how do i fill these days?  
hard to say  
hard to describe  
a nondescript drifting  
a groping through greyness  
a searching  
for something to satisfy  
a seeking  
after something real  
  
there are tons of stories  
that make it sound  
all glamorous and sexy  
about being dead  
but mostly  
it's really boring  
mostly  
all the philosophising  
is inconclusive  
  
thoughts and feelings  
still keep happening  
but i'm not sure  
who they are happening to  
exactly  
  
is it the guy who fell?  
there was a sudden rush  
into blackness  
a confrontation  
with the abyss  

maybe it was the woman?  
she rushed to help    
and cradled a body    
forgetting  
they were supposed  
to have split up  

or the other guy perhaps?  
sore rope-ripped hands  
sprinting for help  
on painful feet  

both those guys  
loved that woman  
she loved the fallen one  
but they fought  
way too much  
to stay together  
  
all that scene  
is on the other side  
of a veil  
where things happened  
to characters  
who had actual lives  
a place  
where people knew each other  
and often said things like  
"hi!"  
and "what's that?"  
and "i love you!"  
  
i miss it  
but if i'm honest  
i can't expect people  
to talk to me  
when i'm invisible
