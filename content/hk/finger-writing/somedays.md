<div class="latin">

some days  
the pain won't stop  
and sleep  
won't come  

some days  
are just going  
to be like that  

some days  
all the stories  
about love  
and its triumph  
over death  
just won't wash  

some days   
everything  
makes you cry  

when death whispered  
in my ear  
when death  
shouted down the house  
I hoped  
it might make me  
special somehow  
  
but some days  
I realise  
no-one really  
wants to hear  
about the end
