<div class="latin">

they try to turn everything  
into a currency  
but regardless  
time itself will steal it

these markets all thrum  
with the commerce  
of youth sex power wealth  
the turbo charged engines  
of desire

your value measured  
in the stock exchange  
weighed in the balance  
of celebrity  
algorithms buying and selling  
our attention

but what  
if anything  
remains sacred?

tears?  
love?  
birdsong?
