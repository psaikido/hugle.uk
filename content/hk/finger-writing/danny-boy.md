<div class="latin">

Michael's only words  
were 'yeah!'  
and 'nuh!'  
enough to hear  
his Irish brogue  

the stroke  
had been severe  

his eyes  
always sparkled  
with mischief  
he'd shuffle over  
and do his thumbs up  
over and over  
forever finding  
something to laugh about  

at the height of summer  
we had a group outing  
to Savernake forest  
the van had special rails  
in the floor  
to fasten the wheelchairs  

he did his 'yeah!'  
and his thumb  
to nearly everything  
it was marvellous  

we had to stay  
on the paved path  
mostly  
until there was a slope   
I stood on the back brackets  
for a bit  
and the two of us  
free-wheeled  
he laughed so hard  
I got carried away  
and went again  
picking up too much speed  
until we spilled out  
in a dramatic crash  
we were far enough away  
from the rest of the gang  
to get away with it  
but my God  
we were nearly sick  
laughing  

'yeah!'  
'yeah!'  
(thumb)  

on the way home  
everyone went quiet  
looking out  
at the hard yellow summer  
minds in neutral    
looping with the swifts    

and then Michael sang!  

really sang  
like a chorister  
a bell like voice  
perfect  

'Oh Danny Boy  
The pipes the pipes are calling'  

everyone's mouths fell open  
by the time he got to  
'from glen to glen  
and down the mountain side'  
I felt the tears prickle   

but when he sang  
'in sunshine or in shadow'  
the heart gave way  

he sang for all of us
