<div class="latin">

we somehow acquired  
a clapped out motorbike  
a washing up liquid bottle  
for a fuel tank  
front brake lever repurposed    
as a throttle  
  
the engine actually ran  
it was very exciting  
but the time spent  
naming it "the tiger"  
and painting it with stripes    
would've been better spent  
fixing its saddle  
  
at last they gave me a go  
on nearby parkland  
instructions were given  
right brake lever  
go  
left brake lever  
stop  
I don't recall  
if gears were involved  
such details drowned out  
by the intoxication  
of the burbling motor  
the smell  
of popping petrol smoke  
  
by gosh I think I had it  
and off I went  
  
bouncing across the grass  
the saddle immediately gave way  
I slid off the back  
the rubber of the back wheel  
dangerously close  
  
highly motivated  
to keep my boyhood danglies  
from being erased  
I spontaneously demonstrated  
the yoga pose known  
as "the scorpion"  
  
from such a position  
I was unable to release my grip  
on the throttle  

weeeeeeee!  
  
such exertions  
had taken my attention  
from any notion of steering  
as it lurched and bounced  
around the grassy banks  
  
far too late  
I noticed a young tree  
supported by cables  
approaching at a bit more  
than running speed  
  
my neck proved   
heroically tougher  
than the diagonal wire  
that pinged me backwards  
  
the tiger  
had a brief spell  
of freedom  
before it collapsed  
into a heap    
and growled
