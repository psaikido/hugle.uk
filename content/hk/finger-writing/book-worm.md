<div class="latin">

the most grown up thing ever  
when i was about 7  
was walking to the library  
filling in a form  
getting a card  
and choosing a book   
Sherlock Holmes   
or Tolkein maybe  
and reading all the stories  
every last one  

ah the thrill  
of escape  
into other worlds  
like dandelion clocks  
drifting through time  
little word packets  
found a home  
in me  

taking a book back  
when the library lady  
stamped the return date  
something like  
joy victory wonder  
deeply intoxicating  
surged through my wee body  
and made me believe  
that just maybe  
life was going to be  
ok
