<div class="latin">

the heat on my face  
from the locust box  
was like being there  
in that imagined desert  
hundreds of them  
very still  
until one would jump  
always freaked me out  
just a bit  
then they would resume  
their alert stillness  
electric noises  
weirdly insect like  
in their artificial vivarium
  
I fed them  
following instructions  
from the Biology teacher  
he had told us  
at the start of the course  
that it was all about  
the study of life  
and so I studied them  

the stripes on their long bodies  
their amazing identical striations  
bulbous darkness in their eyes  
something both scary  
and endearing  
I couldn't make it out  
their strangeness  
captivating  
  
arriving at the next lesson  
I found that the teacher  
had prepared a dissection   
and the locusts  
every last little one   
were dead  

killed in the name  
of a bastard science  
  
if this is the study of life  
then they will study it  
without me  

turning on my heel  
I silently left  
refusing them the respect  
of any debate
