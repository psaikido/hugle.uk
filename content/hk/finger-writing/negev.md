<div class="latin">

I was about to tell him the tale  
of that time doing a show  
someone jumped too soon  
and I took off into the night sky  
holding on with finger tips  
some sixty feet above the stage  
there was only the briefest moment  
to get my hands back in the straps  
so I could break my fall  
upside down my mind took  
a snapshot  
the Negev desert  
the crowd of eight thousand  
the lights on the stage  
far far below  
etched in the memory  
raw terror  
raw life  
but he stopped me  
right at the start  
and said  
"there's no story  
you can possibly tell  
that I can't top"
