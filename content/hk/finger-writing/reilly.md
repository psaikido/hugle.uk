<div class="latin">

on a slow afternoon in the Beehive  
I was working behind the bar  
when this red-faced woman  
came storming in  


"I demand to see the manager!  
I live next door  
and one of your customers  
has just been  
outrageously rude to me!"


"Of course Madam  
please follow me"  
so off we went to the back


I knocked on Noel's door  
"What is it?"  
he called from upstairs  
so I told him  
of the upset neighbour


bump bump bump  
he came stumping down the stairs  
"I'll not be having  
my neighbours insulted"  
he says  
as he opens the door


"THAT'S HIM!"  
she shouts  
and points right at him  
as Noel does a quick 180  
and disappears  
scuttling back upstairs
