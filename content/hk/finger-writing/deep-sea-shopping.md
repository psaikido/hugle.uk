<div class="latin">

it's pretty hard to see  
out of this massive  
copper helmet  
the breathing  
is laboured too  
the water pressure  
at this depth  
is crushing  

the folks out shopping  
all around   
seem to be doing fine  

the lead boots  
are very hard to lift  
and the hangover  
from the whisky  
is blinding  

but I'm wearing  
flip flops  
and didn't drink  
a drop  

honest  

somehow  
while I slept  
someone has sandpapered  
all my bones  
and the fluey ache  
just won't quit  

when people say  
"you're looking well!"  
oddly  
it doesn't cheer me up  
then I remember  
they can't see nuffink  

they seem fine  
which means  
I can't see nuffink  
either  

and so it seems  
we only really see  
when we listen
