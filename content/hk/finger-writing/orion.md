<div class="latin">

hanging over the neighbour's roof  
Orion  
winter's a-comin then  
his glittering belt of nebulae  
solid proof  
of magic  

as I gawp  
and try to remember  
the old names  
I twiddle my beard  
other hand on hip  
and wonder  
if some far distant ancestor  
had ever done  
this exact same thing  

just before an Autumn dawn  
not sleeping  
his dog  
having a pee  

there!  
Menkalinan  
Aldebaran  
Bellatrix  
and just behind the tree  
wow!  
Rigel!  
all a-glitter  

maybe too low  
to see Sirius  
one of the hunter's dogs  
only a bazillion miles  
the other side  
of the shed  

the unthinkable reaches  
of aeons  
of light years  
the immeasurable heaven  
of Laniakea  
all that space  
all that time  
apparently  
the same thing  

what a trick!  

my tea  
will have brewed by now  
me and the dog  
go back in  
he's a pain  
but I can't help but love him  
lil' Bernie boo  
here at the centre  
of the cosmos
