<div class="latin">

after the show  
laughter applause uproar  
echoeing freshly  
we packed it all up  
putting the tent to bed  
everyone wanted to go for a bevvy  
all rosy-cheeked and frisky  
but we couldn't leave all the gear  
unattended  
amps and instruments  
lights and props  
the whole little-big-top  

our visitors told of their circus  
they had a guard dog  
they tied it to the main rope  
hanging from the top rigging bar  
he could roam around  
the centre circle  
ready to give the frighteners  
to any intruders  

so our Jakey-boy  
the 'blob'  
was duly given the audition  
I tied him firmly  
gave him a little scriggle  
told him he was a good boy  
picked my way out  
of the darkened tent  
and off we jogged  
to the pub  

at kicking out time  
flushed with bonhomie  
we wandered back  
what was that?  
something in the distance?  

wooooooooooo awoooooooooo  
awoooooooooooooooooooooooooo  

I rushed back  
bumped through the scenery  
and released blobdog  
all alone in the dark  
trembling  

our mates laughed  
"that's no guard dog"  
but I felt so guilty  
he had tons of extra treats  
he was a much nobler creature  
than me  
I can't forgive that fast  
not like a dog can
