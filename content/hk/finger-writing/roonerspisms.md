<div class="latin">

"to hell with haith and selfty"  
she thought  
as the strock cluck four  
she put on her hee hiles  
picked up her bopping shags  
and went to meet her man  
she loved the way  
he would hist his twips  
back in college  
they had zipped together  
their beeping slags  
and ever after  
where hoined at the jip  
he said   
that's a bandy little hag  
you have there!  
(their conversation went    
in stits and farts)  
he would always be  
her shite knight in whining armour
