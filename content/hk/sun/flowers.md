I looked at the flowers  
while you made the tea  
you had some news to give to me  
I waited and trembled, what could it be  
that could be so big it needed tea and  
waiting  
I knew it was the end of our  
happiness, I knew in my bones as I  
looked at the flowers  
  
the hours and years of our romance  
began to blanch as you calmly advanced  
your reasons  
your reasons for leaving you gave to me  
over tea  
and I looked at the flowers  
  
the flowers I'd bought you to celebrate  
to celebrate your return to home  
and me and not to flee to your new end  
without me in another country with your new boyfriend  
I looked at the flowers  
  
carnations I think blue and pink  
and already dying because they were cut  
and put in the vase to gracefully fade  
but in their passing to gladen  
to gladen the heart but mine passed into the shade  
your sun would shine elsewhere  
how could this happen?  

I looked  
and silently knew that you had returned  
to our fairytale  
as a thief who would take all the light  
and sew the seeds of the weeds of grief  
and so I looked in the calm  
of moments before the storm  
of showers that would fall from my eyes  
and so I looked at the flowers
