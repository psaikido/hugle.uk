<div class="poem">
every few days  
there was new tech to learn  
I couldn't keep up  
it's true  


they would roll their eyes  
when I asked for help  
apparently now  
it was a sign of weakness  


words meant  
whatever suited them  
I hadn't "delivered"  
because they didn't use  
what I gave  


denounced  
in their kangaroo court  
a coach and horses  
driven through  
their veneer  
of "fairness"  


soon it was playground tactics  
I was sent to Coventry  
then drummed out of the regiment  
by a man  
I called friend
