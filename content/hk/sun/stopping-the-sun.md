<div class="poem">
whatever the monk had told us  
I remember being upset  
everything seemed hopeless  
all my striving in vain  
Sally, do you remember  
you told me  
"Hughie, you're one of our stars"  
well I do  
that was a kindness

a few years later  
in your garden  
after your treatment  
you had just told me  
the cancer had spread  
just before my tears  
you stopped me saying  
"but Hughie, everything  
is absolutely  
perfect!"

the sun stopped  
in its track
