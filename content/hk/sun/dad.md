<div class="poem">
I was watching my friends  
do a street show  
when I got the fateful call  
my dad  
was gone  


I got there in time  
to ask the guys  
to give me a while  


the bedroom  
was filled with sunlight  
he lay on his side quite dead  
I sat in silence for ages  
until all there was was peace  


he had been going for years  
his mind leading the way  
funny to the last  
mam found him struggling  
half in and out of his trousers  
mentally defeated  
by the task of going to bed  
his last words were  
"it's my last trick!"  


when I really want to recall him  
I smell the back of my own hand  
here, I'll do it now  
it triggers a memory of childhood  
strangely, vividly present  


it was in his last years  
when he'd forgotten  
his parental stance  
the sternness and distance  
softening into warmth and fun  
that we had our closest times  


we both understood
that love

is for always
