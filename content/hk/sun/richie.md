that stoopy way you had  
and your sudden animation  
long fingers unfurled  
all eyes electric popping  
  
or head lowered  
twinkling beneath comedy eyebrows  
and when something was shit  
you said "it's shit!"  
  
after the funeral  
after the song of the blackbird  
we walked on the hill  
how vivid that vision  
of you turning and smiling  
and waving "bye"  
you always said it  
more like "boy"  
  
it's never going to be ok  
your being gone  
but somehow  
for some reason  
it's ok
