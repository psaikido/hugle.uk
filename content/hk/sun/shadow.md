looking at this shadow  
I used to think  
it wanted to drag me  
back to the abyss  
and so I tried to dispel it  
to illuminate it  
to be done with it forever  
but where there is light  
there is always darkness  
so all I have to do  
is turn around  
and face the sun  
and there it can stay  
behind me  
where it belongs
