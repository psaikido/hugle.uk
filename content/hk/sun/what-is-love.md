<div class="poem">
what is love?  
the shared silence  
of spinning spheres  
singing suns  
sailing stars  


what is love?  
amidst the festival bedlam  
breathing peace  
by trust breathed  
we formed the centre  


what is love?  
soft shushing strokes  
of skin on skin  
always good  
right to the core  
not to be doubted


what is love?  
through the sunlight of our laughter  
and the shadows of our fears  
we are voyagers  
everyday its own destination
