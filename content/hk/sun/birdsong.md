I bathed my broken heart  
in three months of silence  
and birdsong

Easter morning  
alone in the ancient church  
ablaze with clarity  
resting in radiance  
I knew at last  
the healing was done

blossom fell as I left  
a marriage to the Tao

the deity told me  
"love cannot arrive  
from outside"  

the sage told me  
"your honour  
is redeemed"
