what is it  
about posh clothes?  
maybe people need  
to dress it up?  
the pitiful perjury  
the cruelty  
in cufflinks


silks and stockings  
and makeup  
to take her vows  
I gave her  
mine


smell the starch in the surplice  
smooth ironed vestments  
sinful  
God knows  
but the hypocrisy  
in shining raiment  
that's what really shocks


over Windsor knots  
forked tongues  
satin sheen  
lining  
their pockets

The Routinis, Oxford jugglers, Ric, Richie and me, were hired for the summer ball that this photo was taken at. We performed for this bunch of bastards!
