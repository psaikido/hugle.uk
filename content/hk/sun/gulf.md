what a gulf  
that lies between us  
how could such closeness  
fling us so far?  
  
  
the time came  
when it started to look  
like I needed  
to be carried  
and that time came  
way too soon  
  
  
you chose fear  
over love  
even at the cost  
of appearing  
a demon  
who welcomes  
only to spurn
