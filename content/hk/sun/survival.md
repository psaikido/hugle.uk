<div class="poem">
I've been angry all these years  
self-pitying  
wounded  
at the pain of survival  
my faith is that the suffering  
has something to teach me  
but only my body knows  
what that is  
thus the answer  
will not be a thought  
and maybe  
not even an answer  

perhaps Avalokitesvara  
The One Who Hears the Cries of the World  
perhaps he  
can help me learn
