De Lin the Chan Master  
a tigerish air about him  
looked at John and said  
"so, Shen-yen gave you transmission,  
what did he teach you?"  
all eyes shifted to John  
"to see the nature with a  
compassionate heart"  
all eyes shifted back  
De Lin rocked on his cushion  
eyebrows lifted  
"not bad! not bad!"


now it might've been  
a rhetorical question  
but still  


even though I was the student  
and John the teacher  
I can't think  
if I've ever felt  
pride like it
