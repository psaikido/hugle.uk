that dark cloud  
the one that looms  
inside  
that one  
the one made of achings  
of soreness  
the longings  
and fears  
the rage  
the exhaustion  
the one that grows  
when there's not enough  
of what's needed  
all that  
just imagine it  
alongside everyone else's  
all together  
an unspeakable vastness  
a great blackness  
it's that  
that makes us  
the same
