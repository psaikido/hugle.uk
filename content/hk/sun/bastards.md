the fire comes  
the body heats up  
my rage crackles  
and spits  


these ignoble schemers  
Machiavellis  
Davos demons  
hedge fund hooligans  
want the market to decide  
want naked greed  
in charge


they protect the herd  
to milk their profits  
a bovine ideology  
of slaughter  


both Midas  
and Judas  
taking Mother Nature  
and reducing her  
to scorched earth  
for a quick buck  


their displays  
of supposed power  
childish  
boring  
vindictive  


any gesture to fairness  
or decency  
any notion  
of universal welfare  
derided  


progressive ideas  
compassionate motives  
defiled  
and turned into  
"virtue signalling"  


deploring racism  
dubbed "intolerance"  


upholding human rights  
criticised as "entitlement"  


anything to ease poverty  
"leads to the gulag"  
they say  
they think it's clever  
but they are only  


bastards


I curse them  
those bastards  


thrice cursed  
bloody bastards
