<div class="latin">

we'd not done a show  
together before  
me and Dik  


a famously rough  
council high-rise  
booked us  
for their youth club


we were given  
a little cubbyhole  
some tiny store room  
to get ready in  
about one hundred kids  
mostly black  
under fourteen-ish  
were making  
rowdy noises  
as we stepped out


around the stage area  
stood four or five of them  
facing out  
towards the crowd  
arms folded  
being the law


a pang of apprehension  
to realise  
these tots  
needed security


we probably juggled  
and might've unicycled  
clowning around  
but it was a surprise  
to me  
as much as them  
when Dik  
did his escapology routine


he produced chains  
and locks  
and had volunteers  
to bind him up  
and put him  
in a sack


there was a countdown  
backwards from ten  
as he struggled on the floor  


they went ballistic  
as we got to   
"three two ONE!"  
and Dick burst out  
wearing nowt  
but a posing pouch  
sequins glittering  
around his bits  
and still  
all chained up


pandemonium broke loose  
people shouting  
and rushing forwards    
the guards shoved back   
some people fell  
and so we legged it  
back to the cubbyhole  
afraid  


a forest  
of juvenile hands  
banged on the glass  
with much shouting  
and general uproar  
as we hastily  
put on our street clothes


the mini bouncers  
escorted us out  
we made the street  
and legged it once again  


around the corner  
we slowed down  
and turned back  
hearing a high  
little boy voice  
a wee head  
popped around the corner  
and called out  
"we liked you really!"
