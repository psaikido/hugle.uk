popping the lid  
on a violent heaven  

ink  
squiggles off the stick  

bone ivory   
annihilating into  
cerulean blue  
becoming sky  
its aroma  
intoxicating  
a vibration  
you can breathe  

iris widens  
pure magenta  
cyan conjuring  
with indigo  
and jade  

somehow eyes feel  
the frequencies  
down to the feet  
redolent  
with memory
  
summer's goldenrod boyhood yellow  
  
September's burnt melancholy ochre  

violet's first amethyst kiss  
  
red's primal scarlet uproar  
  
midnight's longing blue quiet

forest's calm emerald pulse

the ink by itself  
was always more exciting  
than any shapes they made  
on paper
