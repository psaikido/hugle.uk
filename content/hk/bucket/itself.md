<div class="latin">

John I still miss you  
but not so much  
especially now I've remembered  
our last interview  
we gazed into each other's eyes  
for a time out of time  
where I can see you again  
any time I like  
in that eternal present  
in silent appreciation  
of this moment  
just being itself
