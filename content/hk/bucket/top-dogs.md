<div class="latin">

the top dogs  
our CEO from Murca  
with his consigliere  
gathered the pack  
to throw us a bone  
and to tell  
of the year's results  
the usual damn lies  
and statistics


awoooooooooooo!


in question time  
I raised my hand  
"the bonus scheme  
is supposed to motivate us  
but the bigger the salary  
the bigger the percentage  
ensuring nearly everyone  
feels hacked off!  
how about  
just give a flat rate?  
you spend the same  
and nearly everyone  
would feel great!"  


"that's not the world  
we live in"  
barked the number two  


"don't we make the world  
with our decisions?"  
I asked  


they left it hanging  
as a rhetorical question  


a few days later  
I saw the number two  
in a corridor  
he sniffed me out  
and whispered  
conspiratorially  
"that lefty rubbish  
won't wash with me!"


yes they get the lion's share  
but  
the dog-eat-dog mind  
belongs to the animals
