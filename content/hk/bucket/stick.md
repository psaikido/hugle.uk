walking stick  
on the conveyor belt  
at the airport  
  
the official  
picked it up  
and called after  
the old couple  
who had just left  
  
"I think you've left this"  
  
they turned back  
still fiddling  
with belts  
and jackets  
  
this was the moment  
that I had dreaded  
  
"the stick is mine"  
  
all three  
looked at me  

mute  
  
I still thought of myself  
as a fuckin Samurai  
  
I still thought of the stick  
as belonging to my dad  
  
it's not a katana  
ssssssik  
with its rubber ferrule  
thomp thomp   
  
my cheeks burned  
with a clamour  
I couldn't name  
as I thomp   
thomped away
