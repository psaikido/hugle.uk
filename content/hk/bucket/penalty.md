we were duffers at footy  
but my mate had a penalty  
eight or nine years old  
school playground  

somehow  
he managed to half miss  
spin around and fall over 

the ball lazed away  
diagonally backwards  

everyone laughed   
except Oxley  
he flew into a rage  
and started kicking   
my supine chum  
kicking hard too  
so I pushed him away  
what else?  

the red mist had come  
but I wasn't ready  
he punched me repeatedly  
piston like  
both hands  
in the face  

the   
feel   
of   
the   
wool  
of   
his  
gloves  
on   
my   
cheek  
bones  

surprisingly ineffective  

I couldn't hit him back  
where his piston arms  
were pumping  
so moving my thumb  
over my finger  
door knocking position  
aimed at his temple  
swung round the outside  
and connected  

the squishy hard impact  
didn't feel like much  
but down he went  
like a dropped towel  

curled into a ball  
we left him  

the footy continued  

later he was seen orbitting  
around  
around  
the not so playful  
playground  
handkerchief to his eyes  
head down  

"sorry Hughie"   
he said  
when the bell rang
