Aunty Lally was a star  
she had been one of those boat pushers  
on the big maps  
in the war room  
second world war that is  

in the old black & white movies  
those model boat pushers  
are all young and sexy women  
in uniforms  
with those boxy caps  
with black peaks 

Uncle Tom took a shine to her  
and said he'd marry her  
straight off  
so the family story goes  

I'd see them periodically  
as I grew up  
I loved Big Tom's pipe smoke smell  
and Aunty Lally's exotic red lipstick  

they were filled with secrets  
of the Bletchley Park sort  
or so I imagined  
all Douglas Bader  
and derring do  
also the terrible umbra  
of tragedy  
haunted from the shadows  
Johnny their son  
had died  
crashing a mini  
like Mark Bolan  

when Big Tom died  
he was buried near his son  
as we left the cemetery  
the guys were ready  
with a gravestone  
I asked to have a look  
leaning over the flat-bed trailer  
I read  
"He danced the sky  
On laughter silvered wings" ([*](#note))  
he had been a real life pilot  

years later  
at another Uncle's house party  
Lall plied me with gin  
"I do like a young man"  
she kept saying  
an old lady  
with the same red lipstick  
mixed with coke  
it all seemed like fun  
until I got violently  
and very publicly  
sick  

I'm so happy I knew them  
and I hope they knew  
how much I loved them  

it was long after  
they'd both gone  
I suddenly noticed  
the spelling of my name "Hugh"  
how odd  

at last I realised  
why Tom had always called me  
"Hoo, How or Huff"
