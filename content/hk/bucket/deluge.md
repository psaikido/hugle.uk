above the waterline  
we speak  
and breathe  
an airy world    
where we think    
we are   
where lightness  
loving bright   
reaches   
for nobility  

below the waistline  
slow motion  
deaf unsteady    
wading heavy    
primal urges  
heaving up   
sex   
and murder  
sinking mutely  
into shit

the deluge comes  
regardless  
so speak  
while you can  
and take a stand  
while there is yet  
ground  
beneath your feet
