<div class="latin">

in the Olympian spotlight   
the Gods   
youth beauty power   
success fame vitality  
write a dictionary  
that seeks to define us  
we've been framed  
some of us are cast into the shadows  
the pages of our own dictionaries  
torn out  
there are those among these exiles  
who turn to face the darkness  
and in their listening  
discover a pen  
what might you write?
