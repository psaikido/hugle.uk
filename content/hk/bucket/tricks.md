impromptu magic show  
a large Indian family  
had reacted with fear  
it was a shock  
to see  
how they really believed  
it was something supernatural  
I toyed with the feeling  
such awesome potential  
but soon gave up  
the temptation  
and showed them  
how some of it was done  
"look, it's in the other hand!"  
they relaxed  
and began to have fun  
it was a relief  
yes there's a deception  
but the intent is to charm  
to amuse  
to bridge the gap  
but they are right  
to be afraid  
look at these other deceptions  
the ones that lead  
to lynchings  
to concentration camps  
the appalling trick  
of stirring up rage  
of summoning demons  
like the fear of foreigners  
or the belief in superiority  
I walked away from the family  
but paused  
a little boy tried some magic  
all by himself  
he held a stone  
and closed his hand  
he blew on it  
just as I had done  
he snapped his fingers  
just like me  
and opened his hand  
only to find the stone  
still there!  
his eyes went as wide  
as they could go  
his mouth  
perfectly round  
he really learned it  
that time  
that it wasn't real  
not like those others  
those who believe  
their own sorcery  
that they are victims  
even while  
they kill
