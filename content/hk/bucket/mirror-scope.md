<div class="middle-strip">

always microscoping 

in   
{.para-right}

to the tiniest of details   
insisting     
on the basis of things   
as physical   

mind  
coming out  
of matter  
{.para-right}

others telescoping  

out  
{.para-right}

to the grandest of mysteries  
insisting  
on the basis of things  
as spiritual  

matter  
coming out  
of mind  
{.para-right}

still others scope a  

mirror  
{.para-right}

asking  
what of the eye  

behind the lens?  
{.para-right}

what is doing  

the looking?  
{.para-right}

what of the laughter  
when a dog  

farts?  
{.para-right}

or the worry  
about being  

bad?  
{.para-right}

what of the concern  
when a friend gets  

ill?  
{.para-right}

or the turmoil  
about being  

mad?  
{.para-right}

what of the love  
that could embrace a  

world?  
{.para-right}

or the anguish  
about being  

sad?  
{.para-right}

do they scry  
in their viewfinders  
the broken triumph  

of an ordinary day?  
{.para-right}

the abject comedy  

of a lifetime?  
{.para-right}

I gaze bewildered  
into this mirror-scope  
the gaze itself  
is miracle enough  
{.para-center}
