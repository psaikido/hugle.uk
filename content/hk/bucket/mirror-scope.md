always microscoping in  
to the tiniest of details  
they insist  
on the basis of things  
as physical  

that mind comes out  
of matter  

others telescope out  
to the grandest of mysteries  
always insisting  
on the basis of things  
as spiritual  

that matter comes out  
of mind  

but what of the eye  
behind the lens?  
what is doing  
the looking?  

what of the worry  
about being  
bad?  

or the laughter  
when a dog  
farts?  

what of the turmoil  
about being  
mad?  

or the concern  
when a friend  
gets ill?  

what of the anguish  
about being  
sad?  

or the love  
that could embrace  
a world?  

do they glimpse  
in their viewfinders  
the broken triumph  
of an ordinary day?  

the abject comedy  
of a lifetime?  

I gaze bewildered  
into this mirror-scope  
and see the gaze itself  
as miracle enough
