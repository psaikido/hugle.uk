<div class="middle-strip">

always microscoping in   
to the tiniest of details   
they insist   
on the basis of things   
as physical   

that mind  
comes out  
of matter  
{.para-right}

others telescope out  
to the grandest of mysteries  
always insisting  
on the basis of things  
as spiritual  

that matter  
comes out  
of mind  
{.para-right}

but what of the eye  
behind the lens?  
what is doing  
the looking?  

what of the worry  
about being  

bad?  
{.para-right}

or the laughter  
when a dog  

farts?  
{.para-right}

what of the turmoil  
about being  

mad?  
{.para-right}

or the concern  
when a friend  

gets ill?  
{.para-right}

what of the anguish  
about being  

sad?  
{.para-right}

or the love  
that could embrace  

a world?  
{.para-right}

do they glimpse  
in their viewfinders  
the broken triumph  
of an ordinary day?  

the abject comedy  
of a lifetime?  
{.para-right}

I gaze bewildered  
into this mirror-scope  
and see the gaze itself  
as miracle enough  
{.para-center}
