in childhood we believe in demons  
in adolescence we wise up  
"haha! stupid! they're not real"  
and we are consoled for a time  
only in later life  
after the tears and terrors  
the furies of the night  
do we return to those fairy tales  
and realise how true they are  
how meticulously honest  
to the ravages of darkness
