a brilliant little dog    
was our Sam  
a feisty Jack Russell  
  
he would sit  
with his back legs crossed  
aristocratic  
aloof  
and wait for the railway workers  
  
three times a day  
the big siren would sound  
haunting  
and thousands of Lowry-esque guys  
on bicycles  
would spill forth  
peddling home  
  
Sam's ears would prick   
he'd look up the street  
and get ready  
  
dozens of legs  
going up and down  
trying to shuck him off  
in his deadly   
game of bones  
  
one time he was missing  
for days  
we got a phone call  
that he had been seen  
sitting in the middle of the road  
over four miles away  
traffic streaming both sides  
unconcerned  
insouciant legs  
crossed
