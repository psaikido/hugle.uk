the snow was brilliant  
the whole school  
going mad  
the play ground riotous  
snow balls flying everywhere  


Sister Mary  
in full habit  
came to break it up  
blowing her whistle  
and shoo-ing everyone  
back to their classes  


as we left  
I turned to see her  
shoving the boys   
off the other side  
of the playground  

  
one last snow ball  
might just reach her  
what was that?  
fifty yards or something?  
I don't know  

  
like magic  
it left my hand  
and described the perfect arc  
never before or since  
have i thrown such a throw  

  
even now  
I recall the apalling thrill  
the sheer jubilation  
the back of her head  
protected by a dark blue veil  
went 'dufff'
