<div class="latin">

Joolz wanted to buy the zebra  
it was an actual zebra  
stuffed  
and standing about weirdly  
in the second hand shop  
the natural habitat  
for terrible taxidermy specimens  

the idea had seized her  
and our chum Sally  
and so it was  
that the three of us  
went to make the purchase  

huh students!  

anyway  
it turns out it's really hard  
to lug about  
African equine awkward  
and very heavy  

there was quite a way to go  
and while they announced  
amidst gales of laughter  
that it was going to be called  
Bret  

(Bret?)  

i decided to lift it  
using the classic  
fireman's lift  

as soon as i got it up  
on my shoulders  
i legged it  
for home  

after a quarter of a mile  
or so  
enduring the honking  
of passing cars  
i was shagged  
so i put it down  
and turned back  

waaay in the distance  
i could just make out  
the waving  
of arms and legs  
as they lay on the floor  
in convulsions
