<div class="poem">
when Hughie is freaking out  
Cháng Kè says:  


ruminating on hurts of the past  
only hurts you in the present  
it's usually pain and tiredness  
that is really the problem  
so stop trying to figure it out  
stop trying to fix it  
stop trying  

its only a false alarm  
remember your heart  
is both good and true  
and is made up out of  
everything and everyone else  
and so practice  
is for all of us  

the universe wants you  
or you wouldn't be here  
your honour is redeemed  
the pain is not failure  
it's the fare for the ferryman  
to bring you back across  
just what Mother Nature needs  
in return for your life  

so have a rest  
then take the backward step  
love cannot arrive from outside  
we must return  
in silent appreciation  
to this moment  
just being itself  
and sit still  
in the heart  
with all suffering beings  

have faith and surrender  
to the surrounding hush  
so bright  
with loving
</div>
