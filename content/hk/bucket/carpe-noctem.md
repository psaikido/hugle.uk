slender Sevilla was from Roma  
deep brown drowning eyes  
black springing ringlets  
I fell  
in

she made me laugh so hard  
Greek delirious night life   
last bars closing  
let's find  
somewhere

cat burgling across ceiling joists  
drunken Russians sprawled below  
a locked room  
damned key  
undiscovered  

joy back on the street  
under a lamp post  
orbitted by mosquitos  
she had  
waited  

the Cyclades rocks still warm  
radiating summer's ferocious heat  
night breezes cooling  
grateful limbs  
caressed    

wandering beachward arm in arm  
beyond the street lights  
firework stars errupted  
slow motion  
aloft    

our sliding dark interiors commingled    
lying on the sand  
breath taken plunging  
shuddering together  
immaculate  

racing hearts slowed and soared  
gentle waves came reaching  
a cradled moment  
drifting into  
galaxies  

our youth not entirely squandered  
we seized the night  
honouring Aphrodite's grace    
with our  
yes
