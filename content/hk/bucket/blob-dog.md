he was a big bouncy Collie  
was Jake  
we usually called him  
'blob dog'  
for some reason  
no one could remember  

my dad had taken him for a walk  
and on their way home  
he stopped off  
for a newspaper  
leaving the blob  
in the car  

standing in the queue  
dad heard a car's horn  
blaring  
it went on and on  
as he inched forward  
towards his turn  
at the cash desk  

at last  
getting back to the motor  
he found blobby  
sitting in the driver's seat  
paws on the wheel  
looking most   
alarmed
