cancer pneumonia   
HIV  
choking on a bun  
with your cup of tea  
tripping on the carpet  
falling down the stairs  
the light turns red  
catch you unawares


everybody's gotta die  
but we're still alive

fall from the ladder  
and your back is broke  
the house catches fire  
you go up in smoke  
your arteries are furred  
you block a ventricle  
an ovary a lung  
a breast a testicle


everybody's gotta die  
but we're still alive


thrown from the train  
stabbed in the back  
you lend your kidneys to a friend  
and you don't get 'em back  
a heart attack a stroke  
the wrong injection  
take viagra  
get a fatal erection


everybody's gotta die  
but we're still alive


the perils of life  
are crowding in upon us  
don't sit on my lap  
if you're a hippopotamus  
it started with a kiss  
and ended up in homicide  
nothing seemed amiss  
except a certain whiff of cyanide


everybody's gotta die  
but we're still alive


dangle from a rope  
a hand-full of pills  
slipping on the ice  
the winter kills  
we all gotta die  
we're all on the clock  
reach 98 and your  


heart  


just  


stop
