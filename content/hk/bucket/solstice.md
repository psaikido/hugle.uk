<div class="latin">

a Glastonbury solstice  
near dawn  
a young guy  
balanced on top  
of a standing stone  
at the mini-henge  
amongst the crowds  
awaiting the sacred moment  
trying to have  
some kind of "pagasm"


he had rainbow laces  
in multi-coloured dockies  
purple macrame flares  
plaited leather belt  
paisley waistcoat  
with grass leafs  
loads of beads  
a big felt Dr Seuss hat  
and a mahoosive spliff  
everything looked  
brand new


I looked on  
with a bunch of loafers  
as someone made a remark  
about the poor guy's awkwardness  
his self-conscious determination  
to have an epic moment  
and we cynics  
began to take the piss


I recall hysteria breaking out  
merciless laughter  
people howling  
and rolling on the grass  
one guy  
lying on his back  
drummed his feet on the ground  
and cried  
"no more! no more!"  
I hadn't laughed like that  
in ages  
the fact that he was  
only just out of earshot  
made it funnier still


all these decades later  
with evening coming on  
a twinge of shame  
has replaced that mirth  
a cynical carapace  
hasn't defended us  
from diddly squat


neither his hopefulness  
naivety or pretence  
nor our scorn  
or street-wise posturing  
as we waited  
for our suns  
to rise  
could delay  
our fates  
blazing  
sputtering forth  
towards the setting  
of that sun
