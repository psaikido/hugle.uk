a personality  
and a landscape both  
collide with the present  
only after  
a tortuous formation  

a laval eruption  
of madness  
when a staight jacket  
of regolith  
cracks  

sedimentary deposits  
pressed down over millenia  
into resentful mudstone  

porous limestone labyrinths  
carving chemical confusions  

bubbling springs  
of youthful joy  

alluvial meanderings  
of maturity  

our momentary snapshots  
of the character of place  
take in only the surface  

the kaleidoscope of time  
delivers to us  
just fragments  
created over epochs  

mica and schist  
the granite of high places  
brooding over memories  
of a fossilised sea  

ancient tectonic psychodramas  
authority versus rebellion  
throw up vast mountains  
and arid  
icy deserts  

nothing could withstand  
the glacier's hydrosexual demand  
for the ocean

to wear the mantle  
as it is  
rather than try  
to remake a world  
is surely  
a more graceful way  
to honour  
its contours
