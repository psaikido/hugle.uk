the command I typed  
had a space  
where it should not have been  
a message was supposed  
to pop up  
on my mate's monitor  
it said  
"om mani padme hum"  
just for something to type  
given our conversations  
about Buddhism  


we sat in a long row  
modern day scribes  
at computers  
the room had dozens of rows  
and the message  
did arrive  
"beep!"  
it went  


but then the first row  
all beeped too  
then the second  
and so on  
sweeping down the room  
an electronic wave  
of punishment beepings  


apparently it went on  
to nearly five thousand machines  
across the whole company  
on multiple sites  
around the country  


I had changed the message  
at the last moment  
from  
"shave my back  
and call me Edna!"  


I didn't get sacked  
but man  
I thought I was having  
a heart attack  


clickery tappery  
is no way  
to earn a living
