Padmasambhava aka Guru Rinpoche is the great magician who brought Buddhism to
Tibet.  After the first attempt that was repelled by the local 'deities and
demons' of Tibet, they called in the 'lotus born' one, Padmasambhava, who
defeated those deities and demons by being a better magician and being a holder
of the true Dharma, the Buddhist teachings, the 'way it is'.  He would defeat
them and then let them live and stay where they were if they promised to uphold
the Dharma.  This is why there are so many fierce and weird types around in
Tibetan Buddhism.  The more anthropological view is that Buddhism reinterpreted
the indigenous religion of Tibet, Bon, and thus supplanted it.  Much the same
thing happened in the UK with Christianity and the indigenous pagan religions.  

For me he stands for the fighting spirit, the umph needed for keeping the
practice going.  He's the archetype of the courage and persistance needed.  He
also stands for the total understanding and embodiment of emptiness itself.  It
is fitting that his invocation starts this album as he is the Yidam, the
protector/guardian, of the [Maenllwyd](http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/maenllwyd.html) where
much of the retreat practice I've done has been.
