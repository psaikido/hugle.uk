Before a retreat with the [Western Chan
Fellowship](http://westernchanfellowship.org) in 2008 I was practising a
classical guitar piece, the sublime Bach Prelude from BWV 998, and so had it as
a repeating 'ear-worm' for the first few days. This was a pretty normal sort of
an occurrence. On day three or four, early in the morning there was some sudden
shift and I 'heard' the piece in its celestial glory as though played in Heaven
by Bach himself! The beauty of it was actually painful in its force. It was a
devastating experience. For the next few days I was hearing celestial music
forming, dissolving, forever changing. It was a mixture of everything I've ever
heard and I had not experienced anything like it before or after. On returning
from the retreat I picked up my guitar and before playing anything I tried to
recall something of the celestial music. Over the next year or so I got a few
fragments down. They eventually got recorded by my excellent chum Barry and it
became this album. For the recording I got in the late Steve Carvey for
percussion, Sophie Muir and Pete Lowry for some backing singing. Barry plays
keyboards on a few tracks.

"These mantras, beautifully rendered in a contemporary fashion that retains the spirit of the originals, provide  a profound, musical introduction to the basics of Tibetan tantra and to heartfelt Buddhism in general. The singer-composer is to be warmly congratulated on this innovation."
