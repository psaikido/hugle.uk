I tried to buy 'hughtube.com' but someone beat me to it. Mighty surprised to find that 'hugle.co.uk' was not, so of course I grabbed the domain name. It was years later that I started doing professional magic gigs that I found a use for the domain. Ill-health put an end to all of that, but for a few years it was tremendous fun. Less formally, I did many hundreds of shows and especially enjoyed doing tricks for folks in India and China on various Buddhist pilgrimages I was lucky enough to go on. It is a great way to break through a language barrier.  

During the pandemic lockdowns I decided to use the hugle domain for all my stuff so now it is an umbrella for my various enthusiasms.
