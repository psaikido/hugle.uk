#### MN 14 Cūḷa Dukkhakkhandha Sutta: The Lesser Mass of Suffering

A follower of a different sect tells the Buddha that the king
experiences more pleasure than the Buddha does.  He replies with
"Can this king, without moving his body, without uttering a word,
dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for seven days & nights?"  

"No Friend."  

"Can this king, without moving his body, without uttering a word, 
dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for six (five, four..one)
days & nights?"
