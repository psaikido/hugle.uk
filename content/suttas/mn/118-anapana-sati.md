#### MN 118 Ānāpāna Sati Sutta: Mindfulness of Breathing

"There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of
a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding
his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore. Always mindful, he
breathes in; mindful he breathes out."
