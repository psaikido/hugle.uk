#### MN 106 Āneñja-sappāya: Imperturbable

Not clinging to an identity, or anything at all, is the way.

"I am not anyone's anything anywhere; nor is anything of mine in anyone
anywhere."

or

"There is nothing of me belonging to anyone anywhere,  
there is nothing of anyone anywhere belonging to me."
