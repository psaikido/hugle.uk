There are these four fears of one who goes down to the water.  
Waves, crocodiles, whirlpools, sharks (some translations 'alligators').  
'Waves' stand for angry despair.  
'Crocodiles' stand for gluttony.  
'Whirlpools' stand for sensual pleasures.  
'Sharks' stand for women!


Controversial! "In the village he sees a woman not well covered and dressed" and the monk is overwhelmed by lust and leaves the holy life to become a layman.
