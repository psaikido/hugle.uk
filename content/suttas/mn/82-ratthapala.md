After a struggle to get permission to ordain from his parents Raṭṭhapāla talks to a king and tells him of the four summaries of the Dharma:


- Life in any world is unstable, it is swept away.  
-- old age, sickness and death.


- Life in any world has no shelter and no protector.  
-- you have to feel pain alone, no one else can share it.


- Life in any world has nothing of its own, one has to leave all and pass on.  
-- death takes everything acquired in this life.


- Life in any world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving.  
-- desire can never be wholly satisfying and it generates a feeling of lack.
