#### MN 74 To Dīghanakha: To LongNails

On Vulture Peak Sariputta's nephew Dīghanaka 'LongNails' upholds to the Buddha
the view that 'nothing is acceptable to me'. 

The Buddha shows him how clinging to any view leads to vexation. He then
teaches impermanence, especially of feeling whereupon Dīghanakha becomes fully
enlightened.  

Sariputta was standing behind them, fanning them, and had only been ordained
for two weeks, considers what they are talking about and becomes fully
enlightened too!
