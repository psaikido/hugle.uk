On Vulture Peak Sariputta's nephew Dīghanaka 'LongNails' upholds to the Buddha the view that 'nothing is acceptable to me'. 
The Buddha shows him how clinging to any view leads to vexation. He then teaches impermanence, especially of feeling whereupon Dīghanakha becomes fully enlightened.  


Sariputta was standing behind them, fanning them, and had only been ordained for two weeks, considers what they are talking about and becomes fully enlightened too!
