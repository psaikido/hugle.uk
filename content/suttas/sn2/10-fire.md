#### SN 35.28 Āditta-pariyāya Sutta: The Fire Sermon

The Buddha's third sermon to one thousand monks, former fire worshippers, lead
by the three Kassappa brothers.  

"Bhikkhus, all is burning. [..] The eye is burning, forms are burning,
eye-consciousness is burning [..]. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of
lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion, burning with birth,
ageing and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure and despair, I
say!"

They ALL became arahants!
