#### "SN 55.1 RƒÅja Sutta: The Emperor"

No matter how mighty an emperor is, if they have not got full confidence in the
Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha and they are not confident that developing
virtue is the right way to be, they can still fall into hell.

"And between the gaining of the four continents and the gaining of these four
qualities, the gaining of the four continents is not equal to one sixteenth of
the gaining of these four qualities."
