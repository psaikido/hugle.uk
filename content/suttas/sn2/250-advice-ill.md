#### Ill / GilƒÅna Sutta (SN 55:54)

Advice to give to those very ill and dying: First recall the value of having confidence in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha together with the virtues like in [To Anathapindika (SN 55:26)](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN55_26.html). Then ask if they are anxious and if they are say "Whether you are anxious or not you will die anyway so why not give it up!"

They should be encouraged to give up this world's pleasures for the much better pleasures of higher and higher realms until even in the highest they should give up pleasures entirely and practice for the cessation of identity.
