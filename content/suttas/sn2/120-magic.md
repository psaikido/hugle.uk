#### "SN 42.13 Pﾄ》aliya Sutta: To Pﾄ》aliya"

A headman, Pﾄ》aliya, asks if the Buddha knows magic. He replies that yes he
does. Pﾄ》aliya says "then the Buddha is a magician". The Buddha then explains
through a series of questions that because you know something it doesn't mean
that you are a practitioner of that thing. He tells him how he understands the
hindrances, wrong views and how to practice correctly.
