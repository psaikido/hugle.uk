#### One Hundred Spears / Sattisata Sutta  (SN 56:35)

The Buddha declares that if a person were to be offered the chance to realise the four noble truths after being stabbed with one hundred spears three times a day for one hundred years, that person should take up the offer!

The realisation is accompanied by pleasure and happiness.
