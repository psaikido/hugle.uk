#### "SN 47.20 Sedaka Sutta (2): The Beauty Queen"

Suppose there is a great crowd gathered to see the most beautiful girl in the
land and someone forces a man to carry around a bowl filled with oil between
the crowd and the girl. A man with a sword follows behind and wherever any oil
is spilled right there he will chop off the man's head. The Buddha asks "would
that man stop attending to that bowl of oil?" The monks answer "no". This is
how mindfulness directed to the body should be developed and cultivated.
