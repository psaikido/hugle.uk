A Brahma/God thinks to himself "there is no ascetic or brahmin who can come here" to his realm. The Buddha hears this and immediately appears over the Brahma's head, floats in the air in the lotus posture and meditates on the fire element. Four monks follow, taking up the cardinal points, floating a bit lower down. They are Mahakassapa, Mahamoggallana, Mahakappina and Anuruddha. The Brahma realises his mistake and finds out that there are many monks like these in the Buddha's retinue.
