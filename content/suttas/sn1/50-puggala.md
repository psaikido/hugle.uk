#### SN 3.21 Puggala Sutta: Persons

The Buddha talks with King Pasenadi and tells him "There are four types of
people in the world. What four?  

The person who goes from darkness to darkness.  

The person who goes from darkness to light.  

The person who goes from light to darkness.  

The person who goes from light to light."

He explains that if you engage in good conduct of body, speech and mind you
will be heading towards the light.
