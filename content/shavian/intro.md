...is something I've been looking for for ages. As a kid I was taught '[Initial
Teaching Alphabet](http://itafoundation.org/about-us/what-is-i-t-a/)' which I
really liked. The idea was that you learned the basics of reading with a system
that didn't have all the spelling weirdness of standard English. Ever since
I've been irked by the silly and arbitrary spelling gotchas that abound in this
Frankenstein language. It turns out that the two are related. [James
Pitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pitman) (yes, of shorthand fame)
invented i.t.a. and was one of the judges of the competition that gave birth to
Shavian aka the Shaw Alphabet aka ·𐑖𐑱𐑝𐑾𐑯.

It turns out that Sir George Bernard Shaw felt pretty much the same way and
left a bunch of money for someone to come up with a better system. A guy called
Kingsley Reid invented this 'phonemic' alphabet - I first found out about it
[here](https://youtu.be/D66LrlotvCA?si=CwHkgRO2JzfUj_W5). It was named after
'Shaw' as (oddly) 'Shavian' ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet)).

(it looks so cool)

Here's my 'aide memoire' with the letter, its name and the key combo for the
'Shaw 2-Layer' keymap (see below).
