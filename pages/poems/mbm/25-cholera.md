<div class="poem">
over the doctor's shoulder  
I hallucinated Green Tara  
ethereal light all around  
she winked at me  
and I smiled  
"yes, please yes, I'm ready"  
but I wasn't  
or she wasn't  
and the doctor found a vein


later he said it was  
his personal best  
bringing someone back  
from that far gone  
I remember him telling  
the little Indian boy  
to run  


fast


to get the list of medical things  
he'd just given him  


I had started feeling sick  
just after breakfast  
and quickly lost many litres  
of body fluids  
from both ends  
I was staying in a monastery  
in Bodh Gaya  
and in my cell  
rupturing my life  
into a bucket  
I was trying to raise the alarm  
but then kept passing out  
this cycle  
went around and around  
for two or three hours  
before someone heard me


an English doctor  
months later  
said it was most likely  
cholera  
Christ on a bike! cholera!  
well  
another close call I guess  


from that I know  
that I'm not afraid to die  
it's to be alone forever  
in that infinite void  
that's what grips me  
the utter cold panic  
frozen isolation  
a desolation so complete  
the Queen of the Dead herself  
would turn away  
in fright
