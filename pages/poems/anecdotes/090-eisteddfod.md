<div class="poem">

me and Peewee were put on last  
then the compėre went home  
so our slot became open ended  
no one to stop us

a largish crowd  
three or four hundred  
in rows of seats  
in a semi-permanent hall  
in a park in central Cardiff

we improvised from the start  
and things became wild  
at one point I climbed the rafters  
over the audience's heads  
no safety of any kind  
that was kind of the point

the audience went with us  
the Lords of Misrule  
the children's reactions  
being the main source of fun

at one point I asked  
"Ok kids, who wants to be  
DECAPITATED?"  
a forest of hands went up  
Peewee explained  
all the glory details  
while I went hunting  
for a plausible implement of doom

I returned with a table leg  
and Peewee had our victim  
a sweet young girl  
on her knees  
hands behind her back  
head bowed  
and apparently willing to die  
in the name of entertainment

the adult part of the crowd  
had turned into a mob  
something atavistic  
had curiously seized  
this celebration  
of all things Welsh

things went all the way  
right up to the point  
where I only had two options  
carry out a brutal bludgeoning  
or ask for the applause  
the young girl in question  
took several  
curtain calls
