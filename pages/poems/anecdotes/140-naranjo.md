<div class="poem">
the picture says it all
kind of


there I sit
on the summit  
of that wondrous mountain  
1989 "I ran the world" t-shirt  
wearing my boina  
in the majest of youth  
relaxed
triumphant
an effortless smile


even when it was being taken  
I knew it was both literally  
and metaphorically  
a high point  


fast forward twelve years  
my then wife  
her struggles with low confidence  
and me  
my struggles with PTSD  
on the summit again  


in that second picture  
you can kind of tell  
she really isn't happy  
to be there  


I thought it would be  
a symbolic triumph  
for both of us  
but the effort of getting her up  
added to the even greater effort  
of getting her back down  
sort of did for me  


our last abseil was in the dark  
strangers helped us back to camp  
everything I had  
had been spent  
in helping, encouraging, cajouling  
sometimes sheer lifting  
a person who's fear  
had turned her into luggage  


a few days later  
back at work  
on my way back from the toilet  
between one footfall and another  
I felt a pang  
I thought it was flu  
that was the moment  
that all 'that' started  
the endless treadmill  
of ME  
the overexertion  
on top of the fall  
was something the system  
just could not abide  
the brakes went on  
and all these years later  
they simply will not  
come off
