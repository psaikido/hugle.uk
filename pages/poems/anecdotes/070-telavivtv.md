<div class="poem">

"quick quick grab your costume  
we'll explain on the way"  
Israeli fixers with radios  
hustled me into a jeep  
"they need someone from your circus  
to be interviewed and to perform  
so that's you - COME ON  
the plane is already waiting"

the dust flew up
we sped along  
and skidded to a stop  
at the airport  
more people with radios  
waving us through  
we ran through the building  
and out on to the runway  
the plane looked like the one  
at the end of Casablanca  

a soldier let me have  
his window seat  
"I've seen it before"  
he pointed out the Sea of Galilee  
Nazareth, Bethlehem  
I held back tears  
we saw the golden dome  
way over in Jerusalem  
I was lost  
in astonishment  
the plane came to Tel Aviv  
and wheeled out over the sea  
and back to land  
suddenly I was on the pavement  
no on there to meet me  

I twiddled my thumbs  
feeling like a lemon  
until a car zoomed up  
"Oh God, we're sorry!  
there's been a mistake  
the TV studios are shut today.  
How about some shopping?  
Your plane back  
is this afternoon"  

I wandered around  
found a nice necklace  
and bought it for my girlfriend  
I tried to haggle in Hebrew  
having learned "one" to "ten"  
the guy spit out his toothpick laughing  
slapped his thighs  
and called his friend out  
they said they admired "chutzpah"  

back at the airport  
I joined the queue  
to check in bags and guns  
an enormous man in front of me  
pulled out this massive cannon  
silver  
amazing  
from a holster under his arm  
it sounded like a typewriter  
when he clunked it down  

my turn came  
they opened my suitcase  
and pulled out some beanbags  
two ping pong balls  
some rizla papers  
they guy hefted a juggling club  
with a look of sheer contempt  
it looked like he was thinking  
"how could you kill someone  
with that?"

back in Eilat at twilight  
I was bunged back in a jeep  
"quick quick the show is about to start"  
again the dust and speeding  
this time past a huge crowd  
my brain was already overloaded  
but it was suddenly time  
to step out and go to the mic  
"erev tov kahal nichbad"
(good evening honourable audience)  
8000 people cheering  
really knocks your socks off  

the show went ok  
apart from some dayglo paint  
accidentally poured  
on my hand and in my eye  
just before I was supposed  
to juggle  

the excitement of that day  
faded all to fast  
but that night over beers  
I thought it would last  
forever
