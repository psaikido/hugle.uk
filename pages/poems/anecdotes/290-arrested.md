<div class="poem">
in the mid 90s  
I had a garret room  
the landlord was away  
London  
IT  
a summer hot spell  
he asked me to water  
his grass plants


before dawn  
loud banging  
at the door  
three stories below  


coppers in tracksuits  
demanded to be let in  
there was more of them  
round the back  
climbing over garages  
looking purposeful


I was loaded into a van  
along with a dozen plants  
me and a bored policeman  
took in the aroma  
until the rest of them  
were satisfied  
that there was in fact  
no drugs factory  
their tipp-off  
was false


they took me to the cells  
removed laces  
belt  
and left me alone  
around 5am


not so different  
from zen retreat  
thought I  
and cobbled together   
a meditation cushion  


I assumed the position


size 16 footsteps  
along the corridor  
a slot slid open    
a pen clicked  
something ticked  
a slot slid back  


footsteps louder  
the cell next to mine  
a slot slid open    
a pen clicked  
something ticked  
a slot slid back


footsteps louder still  
my cell  
a slot slid open  
"oh!"  
a slot slid back  
footsteps hurried away


muffled conversation  
then returning  
two pairs of feet  
a slot slid open  
more muffled conversation  
some surprise  
some laughter  
a slot slid back


they were incredibly  
apologetic  
when they eventually  
let me go  
"It's not exactly  
the great train robbery"  
they said  
dissappointed  
as they handed me  
my stuff
