<div class="poem">
the college band  
was modelled on Kid Creole  
and the Coconuts  
1984  
Orwell's year  


eight of us  
different courses  
different years  
not all in college at all  
so we called ourselves  
The Inevitable Split  


we did tons of gigs  
Leeds, Bradford  
all over  


the best one by far  
was at a military place  
an amputees recovery unit  
only us in the band  
not in wheelchairs  


a crate of beers  
got thrown onto the stage  
I tried to remember the chords  
as I watched open mouthed  
at them dance  


I knew you could balance  
on the back wheels  
but I didn't know  
you could pogo  


on one wheel


until it broke


the guy held his stomach  
laughing  
he got dragged off the dance floor  
the broken chair  
chucked in a corner  
another chair materialised  
only to be trashed again


it was like a medieval melee  
jousting destruction  
they shouted for more  
at the end of each song  


we belted it out  
in awe  
at fifty drunken blokes  
in hysterics  
ripping up  
their world
