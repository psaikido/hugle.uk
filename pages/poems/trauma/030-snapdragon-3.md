<div class="poem">
they said I had 90% bruising  
and that I would be ok  
after about three months  
I rejoined the circus  
after only a fortnight  
and re-wrote my part  
removing all the physical stuff  
and focussed on acting  
and music  
  
I was struggling to understand  
just what had happened  
things were just not right  
they did not seem real  
everyone carried on  
just like before  
apparently unaware  
of the presence of death  
like two great dark wings  
the dragon hovered silent  
and I felt my body falling  
but strangely never landing  
from time to time on stage  
even while delivering lines  
I would suddenly see myself  
from behind my right shoulder  
and became increasingly confused  
about whether I had survived  
my body certainly didn't belong  
so I wasn't sure where I was  
even while taking
the audience's applause


in zazen I found a way  
the only thing that worked  
holding awareness on the body  
allowing chaotic feelings  
and trying not to flinch  


today in an anniversary  
twenty eight years  
since I was brought back  
twenty eight years  
of trying to work out why  
there has to be some reason  
for such a miracle  
it can't just be  
punishment can it?  
the daily pain and exhaustion  
has been such a burden  
but it has propelled me  
on the Buddhist path


I remember asking the fates  
if they would accept me  
as an initiate  
to take the wisdom road  
so I have to take responsibility  
and accept reality  
just the way it is  
  
at least one thing's for sure  
and that is a matter of attitude  
if I'm what love do I get  
then the suffering is terrible  
if I'm asking what love do I give  
then everywhere seems filled  
with ordinary magic
