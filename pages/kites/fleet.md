This is the first kite I got in the summer of 2020.  
It is vented and so can be flown in high winds without pulling too hard.  
I love it!


<h4>tarantula</h4>

Bigger than the spider, hence 'tarantula', this one is my all round favourite.  
Most of the [club38](https://revkites.com/club-38/) patterns were flown with this one. It doesn't like too high wind, over around 18mph, and doesn't do well in under 10mph. It is very responsive and stable at the same time though. Brilliant!


<h4>djinn</h4>

I got this lovely kite for low wind days, below 10mph. It seems to do best on short lines. I'm not yet able to predict its movement so it catches me out sometimes. I went for the 'standard vent' model. It's the prettiest!


<h4>blast</h4>

This is the monster! Really fast and pulls hard. It is from the 'speed series' of revolution kites. The [club38](https://revkites.com/club-38/) levels done with one of the speed series is for the 'Triple Master' title.


<h4>XX</h4>

The Reflex XX is like the Tarantula but unvented.
