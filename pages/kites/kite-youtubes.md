For terminology see [rotation codes](/pages/kites/rotation-codes.html)

On completion of the first 8 levels you are awarded the title of 'Master'. They are called 'L1', 'L2' etc.  
After levels 9 to 14, the title is 'Double Master'. They are called 'M9', 'M10' etc.  
The final level 14 has to be created by yourself out of a set of defined combinations.  
Levels 1-8 with a 'speed series' kite leads to the 'Speed Master' title.  
Levels 9-14 with a speed series kite leads to the 'Triple Master' title.
Levels 1-8 with a 10/10 score leads to the 'Perfect Master' title.  
Levels 9-14 with a 10/10 score leads to the 'Perfect Double Master' title.  

If you get through all that you get the 'Double Triple Master' title.
