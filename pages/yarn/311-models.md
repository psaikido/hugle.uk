<div class="poem">
the lorry arrived  
one thousand CDs  
my album  
was here  


a bunch of us  
ran down the stairs  
the guy rolled up a shutter  
hefted out one of the boxes  
one hundred copies  


excitement built up  
negotiating cardboard  
flaps and folds  
then there it was  
Mantrasphere  


![Mantrasphere cover](/assets/images/bucket/MantrasphereCover.gif "Mantrasphere"){:class="half"}


the printing looked ok  
there was fiddly cellophane  
and everything  
an actual real album  
at last  


the first copy  
I gave to the driver  
a sort of good luck ritual  
he accepted with a sniff  
made me sign a form  
and got gone  


there was a party  
a few weeks later  
a programmer friend  
turned fashion photographer  
had a bunch of models  
over for a house party  


it snowed  
I skidded  
mostly sideways  
grimly determined to make it  
whatever the damage  
after all  
you never knew  
we might get snowed in  
and now I was  
a genuine  
bona fide  
recording artist


it might have a Buddhist theme  
but I aint  
no monk
