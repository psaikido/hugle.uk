<div class="poem">
dancing shiva acid  
sixteen years old  
Stonehenge  
surrounded by bikers  
hippies and punks  
I was fresh from Catholic school  
and more than a little  
out of my depth

paranoia came like a wave  
elemental and overpowering  
I locked myself in a car  
and whimpered in fright  
it peeked and plateaud  
as I watched the freaks pass by

a girl held her arm all stiff  
as she talked to her companion  
that was anxiety  
the same that I could feel  
and suddenly I realised  
we were all in the same boat  
we all of us felt fear  
a universal tension  
brought on by how time  
always removes  
all the illusions of certainty

my trembling turned to compassion  
a vast empathy with the broken  
I left the car and floated  
possessed by a deity

at some point near the dawn  
I changed a baby's nappy  
the mum was out cold  
and the poor thing was crying  
I had never done it before

the sun came up and burned me  
my skin is deep sea white  
I got naked and covered myself in mud  
something I saw in a film  
seeing how everyone's minds  
where filled with self-concern  
I saw how redundant it was  
to be self-conscious

and thus at last  
I broke out of the suburban dream  
primordially in touch  
with Mother Earth  
and Father Sun

the whole experience marked me  
and set my life's course  
around that time  
I had my ear pierced  
and thus the rings remind me  
of that ecstatic rite  
a journey of tribal allegiance  
to what I later learned to call  
the Way of the Bodhisattva
