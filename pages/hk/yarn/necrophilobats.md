<div class="poem">
acrobalance  
I think it's called  
Peewee would get knocked  
in the head  
'die'  
and get rigor mortis  
he could then be moulded  
into a base  
Kim would balance on him  
upside down  
pretty nifty


I played the swannee whistle  
for drama  
a touch of mockery  
and gave a facetious commentary  


I changed it one day  
ad-libbing  
"jadies and mentlemen  
watch as an acrobat  
turns into  
a necrophilobat"


now it's potentially dangerous  
upside down and everything  
but watching the two of them  
trying to keep it together  
while having hysterics  
was profoundly pleasing  
especially since  
it took  
some time
