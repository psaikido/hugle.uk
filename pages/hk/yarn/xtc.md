<div class="poem">

my first proper gig  
late seventies  
fourteen maybe fifteen years old  
XTC at The Affair, Swindon  
we used to write  
"XTC R NRG"  
in the dust on cars  
they were the most thrilling thing  
to come from that town  
they were my connection  
to the zeitgeist  
me and my mates  
put safety pins in our clothes  
and tried to punk it up a bit  
the band's effect on my nervous system  
can't fully be reckoned  
the echoes  
of the vertiginous excitement  
reverberate still  
a blast of power  
right up close  
that's what a Catholic boy needs  
raw decibels, invention and pace  
to drive out the fakery  
the polite suburban dream  
exploded

years later  
a motley assortment  
some original members  
including Barry my chum  
at his glittering best  
wheeled out some of the old tunes  
in packed pub  
back in Swindon

they jammed the bit at the end  
of 'Making Plans for Nigel'  
the bit that repeats  
'steel, steel, steel'  
the whole crowd sang  
shouted  
bellowed in unison  
'STEEUL, STEEUL, STEEUL'

we were all wrinkly and fat  
but that edge was suddenly back  
the glee  
the remembrance  
the heartbreak  
the zenith  
the tragedy  
of a nothing life  
in a nothing town  
and yet here we were  
should to shoulder  
dancing  
jumping  
sweating  
singing out  
for our lost youth  
our refound joy  
an exuberant requiem  
an ecstatic lament  

steel

steel

steel
