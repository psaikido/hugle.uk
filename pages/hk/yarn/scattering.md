<div class="poem">
they had come to the island  
to scatter the ashes  
daughter  
son-in-law  
husband


about to leave Thailand  
and not yet found  
a fitting time and place  
to fulfill  
the dead woman's  
last wishes  


the beach she named  
had turned into  
a scuba resort  
bars  
music  
hedonism


I had just come from a monastery  
yells  
bells  
smells  


a chance encounter  
lead to an impromptu service  
at first light  


we had a little fire  
we had incense  
and chanting  
time for people  
to say their bit  
to remember  
to cry


it came to the part  
where she poured out  
grey remains powdered  
a life in the surf  


this daughter returned  
she laughed and cried  
at the same time  


I felt the aching heart  
of the world  
embracing everything
