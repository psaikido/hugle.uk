<div class="poem">
my friend had a gig near me  
and invited me along  
an East European rugby squad  
was about to play England  
at Twickenham

my mate did standup comedy  
they absolutely loved it  
they were out from behind  
the iron curtain  
for the first time in their lives  

at one point a deal was done  
their vodka for my dope  
a super strong charras  
you had to handle with care  

the following evening  
my friend rang me  
"look at the results"  
our new friends  
had set a record  
losing  
54 - 3
