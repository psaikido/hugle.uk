<div class="poem">
people kept warning me  
about the white hat police  
on Naxos  


the last busker  
the previous summer  
had his banjo  
bust over his head  
and had been  
jailed


doing a show  
on the waterfront  
there was a sizeable crowd  
forming a circle  
four or five deep  


it was going well  
everyone having fun  
suddenly some shouting  
two white hats  
burrowing through the audience  


my hat was full of drachmas  
I yammed it on my head  
the people behind me parted  
so I could leg it  
round the corner  


peeking carefully back  
the police had got to the centre  
the circle had closed around them  
it looked like folks were expecting  
the next performance  


a striptease maybe?  
expressive dance?
