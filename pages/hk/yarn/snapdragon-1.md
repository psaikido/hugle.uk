<div class="poem">
so exciting  
to winch up the king poles  
they held up the little big top  
for Snapdragon Circus  


they head hunted me  
to be in the show  
I was thrilled to bits  
1990 and so called 'new circus'  
was all the rage


the king poles were held in place  
by a big heavy cable  
sledge-hammered into the ground  
with two enormous stakes  
that first time for me  
putting the tent up  
was like dreaming


I climbed one of the poles  
during a break for tea and cigs  
looking around  
from way up top  
I realised it was  
"a moment"  
a redolent pause  
where the scene was set  
the characters introduced  
all the drama  
about to begin


that beautiful blonde girl  
big bouncy barky dog  
old green Bedford bus  
I was about to properly fall  
head over heels in love  


musicians and children  
acrobats and actors  
technicians and weirdos  
artistes and fools  
tightrope, jugglery, costumes  
all laid out below me  
relaxing  


the show was basically theatre  
my character an outsider  
who keeps stopping the action  
on some administrative pretence  
the ring master's magic powers  
would trick Mr Gasket  
into performing various stunts  
against his will and in a trance  
until finally he wakes up  
and changes his mean old ways  
and runs away with the circus  
of his own free will


that tour  
that summer  
was the absolute best time  
a boy can possibly have  
some hundred shows  
around the UK  
and finishing in Israel  
representing the country  
The International Festival of New Circus  
but we were still only really  
just a bunch of hippies  


follow your dreams  
everyone says  
but what happens  
when they become


nightmares?
