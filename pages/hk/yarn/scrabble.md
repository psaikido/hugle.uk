<div class="poem">
scrabble at Christmas  
Grandma Burke visiting  
mam and dad in a team  
me and Jem   


clicking clicky tiles  
looking up at the ceiling  
making occasional  
afcse  
cafes  
facse  
faces


the clock ticked away  
intellectual vigour  
then suddenly  
magnificently  
she farted  


deeply  
sonorously  


the adults kept playing  
as though Grandma  
had not in fact  
let one rip  
all three  
dead straight faces  


mine  
and Jem's  
were pressed into the carpet  
belly muscles in spasm  
aching cheeks  


the more serious they looked  
the more we howled  
it couldn't  
be helped
