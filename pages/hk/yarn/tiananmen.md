<div class="poem">
Tiananmen square  
just leaving  
a pair of synchronised soldiers  
in high camp paraded  
super quick right past us  
I think they were wearing  
actual makeup  
John said "not like  
in the British army"  
I said "by the left  
MINCE!"  
and we wiggled our  
bums and flounced  
right under the nose  
of a very cross looking  
bulldog of a guard  
I think I actually injured  
some intercostal muscles  
we laughed so hard  
Ah John  
zen master clowning  
that's what I salute
