<div class="poem">
they were filming Edge of Darkness  
at the Ilkley College Student Union  
I showed up to get some chips  
and wondered why there was  
cables and tech stuff everywhere  
in the canteen  
there sat a woman  
the most preternaturally  
ethereally  
beautiful creature  
I had ever seen  
in my whole entire life  
after a few questions  
some chums lent me  
a notepad  
so I approached her  
Joanne Whalley  
in the glory of youth  
saying I was a reporter  
for the college rag  
I bought her a coffee  
and wrote down  
what she said  
but I wasn't really listening  
having already drowned  
in her eyes
