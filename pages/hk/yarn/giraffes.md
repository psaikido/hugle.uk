<div class="poem">
it might've been Llanelli  
or somewhere just like it  
me and Seb did a show  
at a shopping centre  


we had giraffe unicycles  
and the help  
of a grumpy security guard  
the natural enemy  
of the street performer  


I remember the enjoyment  
of making him carry  
some of our stuff  
making him look  
like part of the show  
his suppressed fury  
made me happy  
a sweet sweet revenge  


Seb discovered he could hover  
on the five foot uni  
onto the walkalator  
that went up  
to the second floor  
he made it to the top  
a death defying feat  
and received a tremendous  
round of applause  


the obvious thing  
was for me to try it too  
he came down  
as I went up  
high fiving  
in the middle  


the entire shopping centre  
at a standstill  
hovering  
without security
