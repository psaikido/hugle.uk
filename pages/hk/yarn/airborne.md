<div class="poem">
all the stories my dad told  
about his time down the mines  
the "coal tattoo" behind his ear  
from when he was knocked  
unconscious  


when my new father in law  
at the head of the table  
declared "of course everyone  
was behind Thatcher,  
unless you were a miner, haha"  
my blood boiled  
as it must


a few minutes later  
my new mother in law  
Cruella  
sprang to her cloven hooves  
and shaking a finger  
right in my face  
pretty much yelled  
"African countries are poor  
because they are LAZY!"


I'm glad I lost my temper  
slamming my fist on the table  
"I'M NOT HAVING IT!"  
all the crockery  
was just for a moment
