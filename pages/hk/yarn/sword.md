<div class="poem">
my old jiu-jitsu teacher  
used to have a short sword  
its blade milled off  
it was used occasionally in class  
it was from Korea  
and had been used  
in World War II  
so we were told  


there were loads of cool things  
that we learned all about  
the stances and cuts  
the formal defences  
this was some of the actual stuff  
the Samurai would learn


I borrowed it for a while  
to practice at home  
once the teacher trusted me enough  


back in my room I studied it  
having the time and quiet  
and found seven notches  
right up by the hilt  


I began to think what they meant  
and reality came to stay  
I couldn't sleep  
with it there in the room  
it gave me a cold shiver  
I no longer thought it cool  
and gave it right back  
at the earliest opportunity  
I had come to see  
that we had kind of been playing  
on the bones

of the dead
