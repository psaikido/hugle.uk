<div class="poem">
that leather jacket  
kinda saved my life  

stepping off the train  
in Sowerby Bridge  
I shivered  
a half snow  
had come  
to kill


huddling through the market  
I saw prominently displayed  
a rock & roll jacket  
red on the shoulders  
red on the elbows  
all beat up  
but lined and warm


a sticker on it  
said Â£10  
so I rummaged through my pockets  
a night out in Bradford  
at my chum's place  
chess, beer, spliffs  
and I was a bit hungover  
and worried about no dinner  
the circus tour  
had left me skint  
and threadbare


there!  
a tenner!  
hang the dinner  
the jacket won hands down  
winter  
won't be sniffed at


back at the bus  
my folks had sent a letter  
inside  
was a tenner
