<div class="poem">
all the gear fell out  
as I started the crux  
of the golden fleece  
at Symond's Yat  


looking down the rope  
eighty odd feet or so  
all the protection  
I'd put in  
popped


my brother looked up  
helpless to help me  


I could've tried reversing  
but that looked dodgy  
the headwall didn't look too hard  
being scared  
would only make a fall  
more likely  


the mind  
stopped  
the moves  
flowed  


two minutes  
of simplicity  
of flight  


of accidental


perfection
