<div class="poem">

a beach bar in Greece  
a gang of bronzed  
German body-builders  
it was my round  
and as I headed to the bar  
their ring leader  
cracked some joke about me  
they looked up  
at my pale scrawny body  
and all roared with laughter

a classic moment  
almost the proverbial  
sand kicked in my face

but then I thought  
of all the nationalities there  
from all over the world  
it wasn't ok to laugh at their skin  
my skin was from my ancestors  
they were laughing at them  
seized by an unexpected rage  
I stared at their boss  
his gang  
one by one  
noticed me glaring  
and broke off laughing  
to look down at the floor  

at last their leader noticed  
his gang not backing him up  
his smile suddenly gone  
I lifted my fists in victory  
the whole bar erupted  
in applause
