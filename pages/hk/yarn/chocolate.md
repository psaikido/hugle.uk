<div class="poem">
long distance club passing  
the final  
European Juggling Convention  
Maastricht 1989  


I had teamed up  
with Pete the Punk  
he had a smile  
that warmed from a distance  
we were up against  
legends  
the hot favourites  
Haggis and Lee  


someone must've nobbled them  
somehow they went down  
and we won  


the prizes were Dutch chocolate  
made into juggling clubs  
a whole pound of it  
each  


flushed with success  
we entered the three legged race  
whilst juggling of course  
I remember it being funny  
but now how we fluked it  
winning that one too  


another wee ceremony  
another two clubs  
making four pounds  
of Dutch choclatey darkness  
to smash up  
and distribute  
a process that took  
seconds
