<div class="poem">
I have to admit  
it was pretty funny  
Jem overpowering me  
to write in the middle  
of my homework  


"Sister Mary is a moron"  


I stuck some carefully cut paper  
over his contribution  
and continued my essay  
over the top  


she discovered the subterfuge  
and called me up  
in front of the class  


it wasn't so funny  
being shaken  


by the ears
