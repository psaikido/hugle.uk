<div class="poem">
in the IT office  
childish geeky banter  
if someone left their computer  
unwisely unlocked  
someone would jump on  
and send a message  


"I love the cock!"


how we laughed


one night it snowed  
boy did it snow  
the buses were cancelled  
me and my chum  
crunched in on foot  
during the slog and sparkle  
we hatched a plan  
most dastardly


an adjacent car park  
was lower than our office  
so there we went  
and side by side  
in four foot tracks  
we spelled out  
a message for our friend  
the esteemed Mr Bott

"Bott (heart symbol) cock"


brilliant  
we sniggered  
and went back to work


our esteemed colleague  
had taken a photo  
and sent it to a mate  
in fun  
someone in head office  
had overseen it  
and that afternoon  
a boss barked  

"who wrote it?"  
I owned up


he gave me a dressing down  
I offered to take the hit  
and get sacked  
if he let my co-conspirator  
off the hook


later still  
he had the same conversation  
with the other miscreant


"I'm Spartacus!"  
we had both said


the snow melted  
eventually away  
into legend
