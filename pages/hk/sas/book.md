<div class="poem">
an open book  
perhaps thrown  
from a car  
lying in the litter  

the spine damaged  
soaked through  
scuffed covers  
all ripped  
but intelligible  
  
the reflections inside  
could still be made out  
one reading  
"I am an open book"  
another  
"all about secrets"  
  
the font claimed to be  
"All-Wisdom"  
sans-serif  
and the type  
was cast  
in a multitude  
of voices  

whole chapters  
given over  
to self-pity  
or excoriations  
about abandonments  
and betrayals  
still other chapters  
triumphant  
or wistful  
raging  
or terrified  
  
contradictions abound  
course humour  
yammed up  
against the ethereal  
the transcendent  

despite a host of names  
the author remains  
undiscovered
