<div class="poem">
why do junkies always  
tell you that they're clean  
and pillars of society  
turn out the most obscene  
the friends who fawn with flattery  
and smiles a mile wide  
it's them that stab you in the back  
they've got the most to hide  
we've all constructed facades  
but falsities offend  
don't they say let's all be nice  
so pretend pretend pretend
</div>
