<div class="poem">
a centre had an open day  
they hired us for a show  
thirty odd teenage boys  
all with Down's Syndrome  
they were tremendous  
and we got off  
to a flying start  


suddenly


in walked Miss Wales  
in full regalia  
sash and tiara  
and unspeakably  
heart-stoppingly  
gorgeous  


the guys were already lairy  
but in her presence  
they lost their minds  


we invited her  
to volunteer  
we would knock a cigarette  
out of her mouth  
with flying juggling clubs  
it's a very old trick  
all the jokes and patter  
well rehearsed  
with clubs whistling past  
front and rear  
she had to stand  


still  


we asked her  
to keep her hands  
by her sides  
and told her  
"if you're going to laugh  
do it sideways"  
in a brainwave  
I asked her  
to clench  
her buttocks  


she was a great sport  
and so she did  
just to prove it  
she turned around  
and showed the guys  
"one, two, clench!"  


it was like a cartoon  
they way they went  
completely  
and utterly  


bananas
