heading South  
in Katie's wonderful bus  
a 1954 Bedford  


it had long curves  
a split windscreen  
and a chimney  
that gave it away  
as a living vehicle  


this was the time  
when the media  
was hysterical  
about "travellers"  


we stopped for tea  
but before the kettle  
had boiled  
there was a knock knocking  
at the sliding door


two guys  
with a petrol can  
and a lighter


they held them up  
and said  
"you're leaving"  
so  
we left


eventually  
we got to Newbury  
we had caught up  
with the others  
and a raggly convoy  
rolled into town  
somehow  
a police escort appeared


at the park  
there were people    
waving flags  
cameras for the mayor  
to welcome  
the travelling show


I still felt jumpy  
and scanned their faces  
these were the same folks  
and you can't tell from looking  
whether you are going  
to get death threats  
or bunting
