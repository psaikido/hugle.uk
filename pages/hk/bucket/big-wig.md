<div class="poem">
the big wig explained  
just how very big  
his bigness really was  
power-pointing his way  
through charts and numbers  
apparently proving  
spectacular successes  
a God of code  
a titan of acumen  


when he came into a room  
everyone shut up  
and fixed their eyes  
on their screens  


he would stride past  
bigly  
and if we remained  
unfired  
someone would sing  
the Darth Vader theme  
"daaan daaan daaan  
dun derdaaan  
dun derdaaan"  


we felt the relief of rabbits  
when the tiger passes by  
in search  
of bigger game  


his big meeting  
in the big hall  
turned out  
to be a valediction  
he had been removed  
effectively sent  
to Siberia  
the levers of power  
exchanged  
for the straightening  
of paper-clips  


he finished  
his big hurrah  
and closed his laptop  
tucked it under his arm  
and paced away  
no-one  
made eye contact  
and apart from a slight squeaking  
from his shoes  
he left  
in pin-drop silence  


suddenly  
my heart went out to him  
what is it  
to pretend to rule the world  
and be  
friendless?
