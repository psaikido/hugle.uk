[Ontul Rinpoche](https://www.facebook.com/ontul)'s answer  
had made me laugh  
"what is your essential practice?"  
"I eat, I sleep, hahaha!"  
we had talked long  
and parted as friends  
outside his room  
I chatted to his wife  
but was distracted  
a repetitive clanking  
on the tin roof above  
Lake Rewalsar  
the Tibetans call it Tsopema  
three stories  
lots of monkeys about  
but this was rhythmic  
and just as I was  
beginning to wonder  
about drumming macaques  
the Rinpoche ran past us  
"EARTHQUAKE! EARTHQUAKE!"  
and we fled after him  
leaping down the stairs  
we stood in a garden  
trees swayed drunkenly  
no wind was blowing  
all the buildings  
huffed out dust  
grey brown gobbets  
the ground heaved  
sickly  
the town let out a groaning  
a strange lament  
it didn't last long  
the damage was minor  
the epicentre  
was the other side  
of the Himalayas  
the part that sticks most  
in the memory  
is counting my mala  
om mani padme hum  
standing with the holy man  
and loving the camaraderie  
of accepting  
our imminent  
demise
