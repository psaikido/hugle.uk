<div class="poem">

sometimes  
doing magic tricks for folks  
I get to see  
their pupils dilate  
their nervous system  
goes off like fireworks  
I like to think  
the child inside them  
breaks through all the layers  
the charade of adulthood  
and triumphantly declares  
"see, I knew it was real,  
I KNEW it!"
