<div class="poem">
a violent absence  
that missing bike  
on the last day of school  
a brute reality  
of theft  
to welcome a pretender  
into supposed adulthood  
twenty years on  
the rattling borrowed racer  
left at the foot  
of Silbury Hill  
part of the ancient attempt  
to refill with meaning  
the endless void  
of incomprehension  
at the strange blankness  
of things  
meditating there at the top  
illegally  
hoping for some transcedence  
or peace  
I felt the background maw  
of the abyss  
eternally waiting  
under the futile upward struggle  
of feeble life  
recycling  
back to Swindon  
back to struggle  
and disbelief at the hardness  
of achieving even banal normalities  
against the roar  
of that apocalyptic  
silence
