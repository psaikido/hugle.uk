<div class="poem">
lazy dust floating  
in sunshine  
through a gap in the curtains  
grandma sleeping in her chair  


a blissful memory  
of simple peace  


she would play at cards  
a kind of solitaire  
and she would never miss  
a radio show called  
"Dr Finlay's Casebook"  
the radio was huge and brown  
with great big black dials  
she used to call it  
the "wireless"


she made soda bread  
and lemon curd  
but I was too young to learn  
everyone else was at work  
or school  
which was actually the same place  
my folks being teachers  


she called everyone "lovie"  
I always thought it funny  
and she had a special tin  
for saccharine tablets  
she put in her tea  


sellotaped inside the lid  
was a shard of glass  
it had stabbed her in the finger  
during the war  
a bomb had blasted  
but she still had laundry  
and got cut  
patting it down  
over twenty years  
that glass bothered her  
eventually it worked its way  
out of her wrist  
and so she kept it  
as a memento  
a trophy of a triumph  
over pain


at dinnertimes for eight  
she would often dissappear  
into silent reveries  
as she tapped her fingers  
on the table  
my dad would slide a mat  
under her drumming  
and the sound would change  
to muffled  
we all went into fits  


she had an operation  
well into her eighties  
gallstones I think  
and the convalescence was long  
one evening  
when everyone was out  
she popped her head around the door  
to say "I'm just off  
to the whistdrive lovie"  
I said something like  
"that's great grandma  
you haven't been for ages"  
and she gave an unusually  
enthusiastic smile  


on the way  
she was hit by a motorbike  
and that was that  


I found her glasses  
on the verge  
when I went to have a look  
I like to think that fate  
had dealt her a kindness somehow  
but still I really wish  
I'd offered to walk her
