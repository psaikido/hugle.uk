<div class="poem">
Bangkok ladyboy  
following us  
leaving the park  
early in the morning  
before it got too hot  
lots of jugglers  
come to practice  
but a sprinkler system  
would douse everyone  
when its clock  
told it to  
and so we left  
and I found myself  
talking with the man  
who was a woman  
all in black  
thirty something  
trying way too hard  
but I felt moved  
by her woundedness  
a tear in the stockings  
she explained her night  
in the cells  
with no breakfast  
the police kicked her out  
having deprived her  
a night's earnings  
a night's solicitations  
and so I invited her  
for grub  
whatever you like  
I felt magnanimous  
and listened  
as she talked and talked  
and ate and ate  
a thick black hair  
protruded from the makeup  
on her chin  
when we left  
she kept after me  
and wanted me to take  
a photo  
but she demanded  
a glamorous background  
not far not far  
I smelled a rat  
and sure enough  
it was a ruse  
to try and make me  
her client  
what made me saddest  
was her assumption  
that feeding her  
was about my need  
and not hers  
I got away  
wandering  
wondering  
about the many ways  
one can prostitute  
oneself
