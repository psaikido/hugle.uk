<div class="poem">
Mrs Nguy died  
her family looked  
for a Buddhist funeral  
they probably googled it  
they found me  


I pointed them  
towards more formal  
and fitting celebrants  
but they still wanted  
me  


ok I had some robes  
and a bit of background  
but you know  
I'm not ordained  
not 'proper'  
and I certainly couldn't  
speak Cantonese  


a few minutes  
before the service  
her grandson told me  
the congregation  
couldn't speak English  


I put away my notes  
for the speech  
now redundant  
and nearly panicked  
but there was no time  
and the microphone  
was on  


I remembered  
the old Chinese poem  
the Chan thing  
about the chanting  
where the meaning  
is in the tune  
not the words  
so I sang  


the singing  
lifted  
we all cried  
those ancient tunes  
reborn
