<div class="poem">
the weight  
of the words  
rolled around  
in my mouth  


tasted syntax  
taking flight  
fluttering phrases  
speckled speech  


painted ladies  
and linnets  
alighting  
as kisses  


a flock of words  
landing and meant  
as liberations  
sent as doves  
received as hawks  


ah but language  
is a cage  
is it not?  


birds sing  
through bars  
we each  
have a sentence
