<div class="poem">
the Chan nuns  
clearly loved  
their abbess  
young and pretty with it  
she had an elemental force

at one point  
as I left the hall  
she was on her way in  
she paused and looked  
maybe sensing  
I had something to say  
"xienzai xin yi"  
(now heart one)  
the best Chinese  
I could muster

she lifted a finger  
above her head  
and slowly slowly  
drew it down  
to the centre  
of her chest  
closing her eyes  
as she went

we bowed to each other  
two pairs of eyes  
giggle dancing
