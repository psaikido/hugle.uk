<div class="poem">
bat detector  
a gang taking turns  
on the headphones  


suddenly transfixed  
by the aching tranquility  
at the twilight lily ponds  
my heart burst open  


I stood away in the quiet  
feeling the fluttery wings  
awestruck  


later on you said  
"it was a shame  
you missed it!"
