<div class="poem">
career, family, home  
three pillars  
collapsed at once  
it took a long, long time  
sifting through the rubble  
to remember  
in a way that needed  
no one's confirmation  
that my heart is both  
good and true  
and made up  
of everything  
and everyone else  
that the totality  
is not complete  
without me  
and so all the practice  
the sitting  
the study  
the yells, bells and smells  
I really do do it  
for all of us
