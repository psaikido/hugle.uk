<div class="poem">
looking down the garden  
pausing with her hand  
still on the kitchen door  
she had just come back  
from a week of meditation  
my heart leapt in recognition  
the poise  
the relaxed stance  
the golden glow  
of love mystery  
all around her  
"she's come home"  
I thought  
"we can both live there"  
my worries vanished  
and not long after  
she accepted my proposal  
we jumped around on the bed  
marriage!  
wow!  
right then we saw a rainbow  
"it must be a good omen"  
we thought


a year or so later  
after the ceremony  
driving home  
on the way back to   
a garden party  
we held hands  
I felt enveloped  
by an eternal peace  
a long straight road  
a beautiful tunnel of trees  
a moment  
to ring  
through the epochs  


a few hours in  
to the garden jollities  
the weather suddenly  
turned cold  
I saw all the goosebumps  
down a guest's leg  
"ok, everyone to the hall"  
I announced  
and right then the thought  
"not another omen is it?"  


carrying the cake  
through the streets  
on my head  
I didn't know  
that yes  
it was  


boy

was I in for it
