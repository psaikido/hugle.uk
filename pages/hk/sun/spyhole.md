<div class="poem">
spy hole  
before the show  
I'd peep through  
at the excited kids  
their candyfloss  
so much to see  
rubber necks  
a thrumming  
of expectancy  
my soul battery  
down to nothing  
I was  
a vampire  
trying to draw in  
their energy  
to feed  
on their light  
to anchor myself  


lost  


in an ocean  
of darkness
