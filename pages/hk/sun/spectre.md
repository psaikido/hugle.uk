<div class="poem">
I startled awake  
didn't recognise the room  
where was I?


waiting for my memory  
to wake up  
and tell me  
I felt a pressing need  
to remember  
to not lose the plot


four five years  
travelling  
touring  
doing shows  
having adventures  
and I'd come unstuck  
and rattled loose  
a spectre  
searching  
for home


it seemed terribly important  
that my life story  
should not end  
in this vague blank  
that I should not  
linger  
in that nameless place  
as an extra  
a walk-on


I didn't have a script  


here was a deep fear  
it has always seemed  
that the folks around me  
had lives  
and backstories  
even names and stuff  
to be actual people  
that their lives  
really were  
well


real
