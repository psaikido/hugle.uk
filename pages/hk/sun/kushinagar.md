<div class="poem">
that massive bell rang  
here where the Buddha died  
polyphonic primal purity  


rang  
reverberating expansion  
the frequency of magic


rang  
evening's azure vibration  
indigo resonance of awe


rang  
under the mythril moon  
silver sickle celestial  
exquisite


that Dharma wheel  
still ringing  
its ancient presence  
pristine
