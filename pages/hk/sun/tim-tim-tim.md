<div class="poem">
Tim Tim Tim  
my terrifying brother  
the kind of fright  
you put in me  
as we were growing up  
forced me to find my feet  


and then the other Tim  
who showed me  
the stars  
and the birds  


and my God  
that lifetime of your art  
that mysterious magic  
that no one understands  


no one
