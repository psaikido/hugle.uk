<div class="poem">
practising my juggling  
one day in Oxford  
a passing priest  
asked if I'd do a show  
at an old folks home  
at the end of the street  


a few days later  
I showed up  
suitcase and suit  
and met a few dozen  
elderly Catholics  
all  
exceedingly posh  


it was that one perfect show  
not a single drop  
and all my hardest tricks  
sometimes it just slots together  
and there's something  
sublime  


three ball pirouette  
heel flick to fountain  
four ball mill's mess  
fifth ball taken from toe  
three minute club routine  


in my overblown imagination  
that faultless performance  
came to mean something  


me and the ancestors  
honouring  
each other
