<div class="poem">
he's gone    
into the big nowhere  
Ben  
you funny guy  
  
  
that looming presence  
both awkward  
and comic  
has been in mind  
these last few days  
  
  
I wonder if you knew  
how much grief  
love and missing  
there's been?  
  
  
always mad for bicycles  
you are recycled  
and have raced away  
into that big nowhere  
  
  
who can say  
there is a glacier  
named after them?  
  
  
snatched away  
into the big nowhere  
just as I was  
in our late twenties  
I was returned  
you  
were not  
  
  
in the first shock  
of that absence  
I would have swapped  
my burdensome body  
for yours  
so young  
so sweet  
your wit  
and kindness  
was needed  
  
  
I hope we'll meet  
in that big nowhere  
somehow to restore  
the faith that was broken  
in that abrupt rupture  
that cataclysm  
the schism  
between here  
and nowhere  
  
  
somehow to regain friendship  
with that great  
big  
nowhere
