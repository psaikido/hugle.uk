man but that train  
just rolled on forever  
clanking  
lumbering  
across the vastness  
of India  
"chai, chai, masala chai"  
the cries of the hawkers  
selling sweet tea  
more like hot cola  
no fizz  
roasted pecans  
in funnels of newspaper  
I lost my bearings  
and tried to recall  
what life was like  
before getting on  
and heading East  
one afternoon  
a large family came  
traditional Hindu  
many generations  
I played with the kids  
did magic tricks  
for everyone  
we pointed out  
interesting sights  
through the bars  
of the carriage  
as we banged out  
the interminable miles  
and enjoyed  
being pleasant  
with each other  
unencumbered  
by conversation  
only a few  
shared words  
the evening came  
jolting  
and lurching  
towards the night  
I hadn't bought a berth  
and started making  
a nest  
on the floor  
two of the older boys  
bunked together  
so they could offer me  
a bed  
a gesture  
that still moves me  
the surprise  
of kindness  
the planet turned  
under our wheels  
my eyes leaked  
with gratitude  
that a home  
could be found  
anywhere
