"Just as when boys or girls are playing with little sand castles, as long as they are not free from passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, & craving for those little sand castles, that's how long they have fun with those sand castles, enjoy them, treasure them, feel possessive of them.

"Practice for the ending of craving because that unbinding."
