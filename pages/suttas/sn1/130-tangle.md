A brahmin called Jaṭā Bharadvaja says to the Buddha:  

"A tangle within,  
a tangle without,  
people are entangled  
in a tangle.  
Gotama, I ask you this,  
who can untangle this tangle?"  

The Buddha replies:  

"Where name-&-form,  
along with perception  
of impingement & form,  
totally stop without trace:  
that's where the tangle  
is cut."


Incidentally, 'Jaṭā' means 'tangle'! He asks to ordain and thereafter becomes one of the arahants.
