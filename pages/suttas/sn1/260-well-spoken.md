Venerable Visakha gives a great Dhamma talk. He was instructing, exhorting, inspiring and gladdening the monks with words polished, clear, articulate, expressing well the meaning, comprehensive and unattached.  


The Buddha hears it and says:  
'When the wise man is in the midst of fools,    
They do not know him if he does not speak'  

'He should speak and explain the Dhamma.  
He should raise high the seer's banner.  
Well spoken words are the seer's banner.
For the Dhamma is the banner of seers.'
