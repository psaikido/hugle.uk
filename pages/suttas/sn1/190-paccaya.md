The Buddha teaches [Dependent Origination](/pages/suttas/sn/165-ps.html) and adds that someone who has understood it would not run back into the past thinking:  

"Did I exist in the past?  
Did I not exist in the past?  
What was I in the past?  
How was I in the past?  
Having been what, what did I become in the past?"  

That person would not run off to the future with similar questions.  

They would not become confused about the present asking:  

"Do I exist?  
Do I not exist?  
What am I?  
How am I?  
This being - where has it come from and where will it go?"
