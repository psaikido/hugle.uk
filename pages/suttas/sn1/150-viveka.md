A bhikkhu has many unwholesome thoughts that 'gush outwardly'. A devata comes to him and says:

- "remove the desire for people, then you'll be happy"

- "abandon discontent and be mindful"

with a shake flicks off the sticky dust,  
so a bhikkhu, strenuous and mindful,  
with a shake flicks off the sticky dust"
