A cosmologist (C) asks the Buddha (B) a series of questions:  

C: "Does everything exist?"  
B: "This is the oldest cosmology."  


C: "Does everything not exist?"  
B: "This is the second oldest cosmology."  


C: "Is everything a unity?"  
B: "This is the third form of cosmology."  


C: "Is everything a plurality?"  
B: "This is the fourth form of cosmology."  

B then goes on to say that his teaching avoids these extremes and 'teaches by the middle' ie. [dependent origination](/pages/suttas/sn/165-ps.html)
.


This sutta shows that the Buddha did not hold to the doctrine of 'all is one' as we so often here.
