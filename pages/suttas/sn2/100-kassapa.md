Citta, a white-cloth wearing lay follower, meets with the naked ascetic Kassapa, an old friend of his, and asks what gains he has realized from the spiritual life. Kassapa admits he has realized no higher attainments, whereupon Citta reveals he has realized many such attainments.  


Kassapa decides to ordain as a Buddhist monk and later gains enlightenment and becomes 'Mahā Kassapa'.
