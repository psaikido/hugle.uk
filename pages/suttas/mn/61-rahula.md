The Buddha talks to his son, Rahula, on the occasion of his ordination at seven years old.

"Rahula, do you see this little water left in the water vessel?"  
"Yes"  
"Even so little, Rahula, is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie."  
He then throws the water away, turns the vessel upside down and shows it empty.  
"Even so empty and hollow, Rahula" are those same people.  


An action of body, speech and mind should be reflected on before, during and after asking "would it lead to my own and or other's affliction? Is it unwholesome with painful consequences?"  
If the answer is 'yes' before then you don't do it, if during you suspend it, if after you confess it.
