---

Do not pursue the past.  
Do not lose yourself in the future.  
The past no longer is.  
The future has not yet come.  
Looking deeply at life as it is in the very here and now, the practitioner dwells in stability and freedom.  
We must be diligent today.  
To wait till tomorrow is too late.  
Death comes unexpectedly.  
How can we bargain with it?  
The sage calls a person who dwells in mindfulness night and day, ‘the one who knows the better way to live alone'.
