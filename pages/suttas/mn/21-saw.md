Monks, there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you:  
timely or untimely,  
true or false,  
affectionate or harsh,  
beneficial or unbeneficial,  
with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate.  


In any event, you should train yourselves: "Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare, with a mind of goodwill, and with no inner hate."


Monks, even if bandits were to carve you up savagely, limb by limb, with a two-handled saw, he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding.
