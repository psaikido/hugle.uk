The Buddha teaches Sunakkhatta that 'aquisition is the root of stress'. If you want to avoid suffering one must practise restraint of the senses and not be attached to unwholesome things.


"Suppose there were a deadly poisonous viper, and a man were to come along, wanting to live, not wanting to die, desiring pleasure, & abhorring pain. What do you think, Sunakkhatta — would he give his hand or finger to the snake knowing that 'Having been bitten by this, I will incur death or death-like suffering'?"
