<div class="poem">
a professional maths teacher  
asked us  
"how many right angles  
in the corner of the room?"  
the class dutifully responded  
"three"  
"no, four" she said  
and claimed another  
"look, right across the ceiling"  
me and Kevin protested  
"what about the other two walls then?  
surely that's six  
or even infinity  
if you allow that one"


my mistake  
was in telling the truth  
that she was factually wrong  
she demanded silence  
and restated  
her ridiculous claim  


a few days later  
filing out of assembly  
she noticed my shirt  
little pictures  
of bicycles or trains or something  
a technical infraction  
of a little known rule  


she sent me for the strap  
I waited outside Eagen's office  
on his way in  
I saw him spit  
another thing  
that would've got us punished  


twice he put his back into it  
leather across the palm  
any semblance of integrity  
they believed they had  
vanished right then  
never to return
