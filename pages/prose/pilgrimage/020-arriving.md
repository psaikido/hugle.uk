The plane lands in Leh, the capital of Ladakh, and taxis along the
runway. A big dog lopes along and merely glances over its shoulder
at the plane bearing down upon it, unconcerned. I am impressed with
its style! The pressure doors open and the cold mountain air lets us
know straight away that we are really high above sea level, some
3500 metres. By the time we have walked over to the terminal the
high altitude starts to make its effects known. My legs feel very
heavy but my head is helium light. I am met by my host Ngawang who
looks after me and advises that one should do very little while one
is acclimatising to the altitude. Between naps I meditate.

half a day in the air  
the world wildly different  

sizzling skies  
Martian Himalaya

behind the noise  
the same silence

of home
