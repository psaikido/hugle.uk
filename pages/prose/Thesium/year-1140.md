The Evempiricals hold sway and the Neemians are cast down. Women, slaves and sexual non-conformists seek equality. Their argument that it is False to consider them inferior is accepted by all but the Neemians. 

The White Coats are by this time distinctly more intelligent. They use the rebellion of the Evempiricals to aquire Capital. They declare that since the Neemian's Story is False society is now a Meritocracy. In the ensuing free-for-all they amass huge wealth.
