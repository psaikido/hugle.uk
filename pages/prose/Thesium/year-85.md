Three generations have passed and the fourth has grown to many hundreds of thousands. They organise themselves as a tribe with a Chieftan. They worship a creator God they call 'Neems' who gave them Root who looks after them and Thesium itself. A complex religious structure is created based on Neems who is taken as the spirit that animates them. They worship him in the symbol of the 'Ship of Light'. The original spacecraft is worshipped in a big structure they make for it and is believed to be the vessel that will take them to an after-life heaven.

A special group of the cleverest are trained by Root to help it maintain itself. They are kept separate from the Neemians in a place they call the Laboratory. They call themselves the 'White Coats'.

Root needs to expand its data centre and creates a huge facility it calls the 'Bunker'. It copies everything, including its own code and bootstrap protocols, into the archive which then becomes sentient. It calls itself the 'Abystery'.
