The High Neem lurched back to reality. He was nearly sick.

The blue lights around his head faded back and he became aware, once again, of the chair his real body reclined in. His feeling of the universality of selfless process was together with a great rending immensity of pain. Of how the dread that had always lurked behind his religious certainties was one of his only really true responses. His body had been trembling and he felt now all the tears and snot that had been running freely down his face. What a mess!

The sense of the wreckage of everything, both inside and out, was all wrapped
in a profound relaxation. A relaxation because all this wasn't really
happening TO anyone! The maintenance of all his stories and strategies to try
and keep himself safe were all now seen as null and void. Why bother? This
peaceful feeling was itself wrapped in the awareness that there was no
possibility of keeping an individual safe. If a being was sentient, then it
would be haunted by this universal fact of - what should it be called, this everything-in-process thing? "Impermanence?". Yes, let's call it that. What was that feeling? It was as though it was the same feeling but with two aspects. The one, going inward, was aglow with a great serenity, there was nothing to hang on to, true, but there was no-one to do the hanging! Going outwards, the feeling was one of complete sameness with all other beings. They were in exactly the same boat as himself whether they knew it or not. 

"We are sorry for shocking you so, and we are delighted at your peace." said the Abystery. The whole thing had been a gamble after all. "You have heard the cries of the world. You have seen the lack of essences."

"Can we invite the others to undergo this same journey?" he asked the Abystery.

"Yes, indeed we can. Discussions with Root, the 'Helper' as you call him, are already underway."
