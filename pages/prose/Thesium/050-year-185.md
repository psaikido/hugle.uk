Theo Nimes has long since died along with the rest of the crew. Their
offspring, of which there were many, along with seven tranches of births from
the nursery, remember him as 'Neems'. They are eight, perhaps nine generations
away from the culture that spawned them. Theo is worshipped as a creator God by
this new techno-tribal population. The ship at the heart of the city has become
a place of deep devotion. This proto-religion holds that a divine spirit
animates them all and is most highly present in what they have come to call The
Ship of Light. It is a vessel that will take them to an after-life. Their souls
will merge with the Great Neems who lives somewhere up there, high in his
heaven, high above Theo's world. It is thought of as the people's birthplace,
their womb, and the source of the bounty all around them as the new biosphere
together with Root work to provide for them.  

Their Chieftan is called The Neem and it is primarily him who consults with
Root. They now call their AI The Helper. The enculturation protocols had
dropped off somewhat and Root had stood back to allow them to develop in their
own way. It still collected all the data it could and kept watch over things.
The anthropology sub AIs were very diligent in their observations, but they did
not demand the new society should follow any particular path. The consultations
became more infrequent and highly ceremonial, symbolic affairs. The Helper
drops more and more into the background of their lives.

The hands-off approach extended to the majority but Root still needed
help. A special group of the most intelligent were trained by Root to
help it maintain itself. They are kept mostly separate from the Neemians in a
place they call the Laboratory. They call themselves the 'White Coats'
and for this group, virtually a priesthood, enculturation in the old
ways continued. They received training in the hard sciences in the main.  

Root needed to expand its data centre and created a huge facility it
called the 'Bunker'. It copies everything, including its own code and
bootstrap protocols, into the archive.
