The society is structured like a walled garden. In the outer circles there are
vast shanty towns of mostly unregulated space. Crime runs rife. Mob killings
are common. Superstition rules and the central religion of Neemianism has
multiple offshoots and mutations.

Closer to the centre are industrial belts of factories and prisons together
with the outer suburbs. They house the workers who get the majority of
everything done in the factories, nurseries and farms. The infrastructure is
maintained from here.

Closer in again are the administration zones, schools, gyms and entertainments.
Police centres based in this zone maintain control of the population. The inner
suburbs are interspersed throughout and house the more wealthy. 

Around the central Cathedral are the grand halls of government. Heavily policed
and guarded, these bastions keep the outer hoards out. These are the corridors
of power. One half of this inner circle is the Laboratory. Here Root keeps and
trains the White Coats. They facilitate the technical aspects of the great AI
and have special dispensation to live beyond the dictat of the High Neem. The
entrance to the Bunker is kept safe at its base.

The Cathedral itself, towering over all, houses the High Neem and his couterie
of Cardinals. His word is law which emanates out through the circles to the
rest of Thesium.

At the very centre of the Cathedral is the Ship of Light itself.

After the insurrection there is a terrible suppression of Evempirical thought.
Only the Top Prof and a small team is allowed to continue working. The Ship of
Light is rebuilt but people remain restive. Everyone had seen for themselves
how the Ship lay in parts, all its components exposed and no soul could be seen
by anyone. This troubled the High Neem most of all, because he couldn't see it
either. Groups of theologians were assembled to come up with ever cleverer
arguments to sustain Neemianism.

Where they lost most ground was over diseases that were running rife. The
declarations that generations of High Neem had given over these troubles were
becoming harder and harder to sustain. When a really high up person got really
ill they went to the White Coats who got the Helper to, well, help! Underground
knowledge that the Neemian way was not entirely correct could not be completely
suppressed.
