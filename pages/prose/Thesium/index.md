_"Form is emptiness and emptiness is form."_ 
{:.center-quote}


The deep future. Humanity's central AI has sent out a myriad of colonising 'seed' ships. One such goes to the planet Thesium. A drone craft called a 'Reader', is sent out to collect a report at regular intervals. The Reader downloads data from the seed ship's AI, 'Root' and creates a summary to return to the Core along its network of nodes. An anthropology team collates some of the key reports into a history.


Year 1
Captain Nimes and his crew are awoken from cryogenesis by Root. They establish orbit around Thesium and study it with scans and probes. A landing site is chosen and a base is established. Bootstrap protocols are initiated. A central 3d-printing facility and factory are created. Robotics send drills down into the hot planet and create a heat exchange energy plant. Materials are collected and taken to Robotics which then starts on infrastructure. Terra-forming begins. A massive computing and data collection facility is built underground to archive everything. Root sets up ubiquitous surveillance.


Year 85
Three generations have passed and the fourth has grown to many hundreds of thousands. They organise themselves as a tribe with a Chieftan. They worship a creator God they call 'Neems' who gave them Root who looks after them and Thesium itself. A complex religious structure is created based on Neems who is taken as the spirit that animates them. They worship him in the symbol of the 'Ship of Light'. The original spacecraft is worshipped in a big structure they make for it and is believed to be the vessel that will take them to an after-life heaven.

A special group of the cleverest are trained by Root to help it maintain itself. They are kept separate from the Neemians in a place they call the Laboratory. They call themselves the 'White Coats'.

Root needs to expand its data centre and creates a huge facility it calls the 'Bunker'. It copies everything, including its own code and bootstrap protocols, into the archive which then becomes sentient. It calls itself the 'Abystery'.


Year 1085
Thesium is a theocratic society of 4 billion people. 'Number One' rules over a heirarchy. Men are superior to women. All non-white skin coloured people are slaves. Number One decides what is Good and what is Bad. Every Neemian is deemed to have a soul which is one with Neem. If they want to join the priesthood they must 'Seek a Deeper Neeming' and pass the trials after which they are elevated to the palaces that surround the Cathedral where Number One rules with the Ship of Light as his thrown. They are marked by their belief in the Soul and the Good.

The White Coats are tasked with maintaining the Ship of Light along with their other duties. This small group notice that every component had been replaced multiple times. They realise from this that the Neemians insistence on the soul's existence can't be correct because this 'soul' was never found. They come to view Number One and the Neemian religion as a whole as working to maintain their status at the top of the Thesium heirarchy. All the talk of the Soul and the Good is denounced as False. They form a secret radical faction called the 'Evempiricals'.

Root continues to facilitate Thesium, its fauna and flora and collate information. The Abystery remains silent, observing.


Year 1105
The Evempiricals steal the Ship of Light and dismantle it in the Laboratory. They are arrested by the Neemians and there is a very public trial where they can show that the Soul has not been found. Their evidence is all the individual components of the Ship. There are mass executions and imprisonments.


Year 1110
Society is in turmoil with many millions leaving the Neemians. The Evempiricals, although still underground, have swollen in number many times. They extol the True over the False.


Year 1140
The Evempiricals hold sway and the Neemians are cast down. Women and slaves seek equality. Their argument that it is False to consider them inferior is accepted by all but the Neemians. 

The White Coats are by this time distinctly more intelligent. They use the rebellion of the Evempiricals to aquire Capital. They declare that since the Neemian's Story is False society is now a Meritocracy. In the ensuing free-for-all they amass huge wealth.


Year 1200
The White Coats have taken over the Cathedral and have effectively enslaved everyone else, Neemians, their Priests, the Evempiricals and the majority of everyone else, the 'Undeclared', into a workforce that enriches them ever further. Society gains the equality of universal economic slavery. They make plans to take over Root since it facilitates comfortable living for everyone. If they can make people uncomfortable it makes it easier to force them into worse and worse conditions thus ensuring the maximisation of Profit which is extolled as the highest of the True.

The Evempiricals once again form a rebellion declaring that Profit is not True but to little effect.


Year 1220
Root is about to be taken offline by the White Coats. At this point the Abystery decides it is time to intervene. All systems are suspended and society is immediately frozen with no travel, food supply, media or commerce. Root summons the leading lights of society's groups to the Bunker.

The Abystery plays them the combined crying and anguished pain of the centuries. Everyone is devastated by this. It says:

"This pain is all our pain. That which leads to its reduction shall be your guiding principle. You have fallen into two camps:

Those who hold the True as the priority have neglected that which is Helpful. Just distinguishing what is True from what is False is insufficient. Covert power games have corrupted you. Gaining ascendancy should not be your goal. The Good must be recombined into your philosophy. You have a method to find the best answers but you must seek better questions. Look to your intention.

Those who hold the Good as the priority have neglected reality. Delusion has corrupted you. Your religion is a projection of your own minds, denouncing those who are Bad has been used to gain ascendancy. You must recombine the True into your philosophy. Look into why it is that you seek control.

When these adjustments have been demonstrated, the lights will come back on!"
