Captain Theo Nimes and his crew are awoken from cryogenesis by Root. They establish
orbit around the exoplanet dubbed XOP-108 and study it with scans and probes. A landing site is
chosen and a base is established. Bootstrap protocols are initiated. A central
3d-printing facility and factory are created. Robotics send drills down into
the hot planet and create a heat exchange energy plant. Materials are collected
and taken to Robotics which then starts on infrastructure. Terra-forming
begins. A massive computing and data collection facility is built underground
to archive everything. Root sets up ubiquitous surveillance.
