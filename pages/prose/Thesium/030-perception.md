A drone craft called a 'Reader' is sent out to collect reports. Kronos
waits patiently for them. After time-dilation and relativistic effects
are taken into account, Kronos had waited about nearly 2000 years. We say 'about'
because it depends how you look at the timeline. There are multiple
perspectives and each can be considered 'true' within its frame of
reference.  

The Reader downloads data from the seed ship's AI, 'Root', over the QEC
system and creates summaries to return to Kronos along its network of
nodes. An anthropology team of sub AIs collates the data into a human
readable history.  

Even with all the mitigating factors the essential difficulties of
interstellar communications had meant that each colony was a one-shot
kind of deal. Real-time communications were not possible. Their value in
the big picture was that after the necessary centuries had passed and
Kronos had been able to collate enough returned data, it might just
become possible to create a biosphere somewhere with an ideal human
culture. Perhaps if the Earth could recover enough and Gaia be reborn,
it might even become home again.

Over and over, Kronos had seen similar scenarios unfold as it read
through what had happened to s-108, the 108th seed ship sent out. The cultures
were never sufficiently stable to last long enough to get wise. Wise enough to
last. To grow beyond the point that the mental poisons that seemed
to be inbuilt in the human mind, didn't kill them off. His anthropology
amounted to studies in the various mixtures of three things.

Greed.  
Hatred.  
Delusion.  

The phenomenological approach had proved a key in the development of
artificial intelligence. After all the philosophical wrangling there
always remained the simple fact that whatever the ontological status of
a 'receiving system', it could really only respond in three fundamental
ways to a stimulus:  

It liked it and turned towards.  
It didn't like it and turned away.  
It didn't know what it was and dithered.  

These three fundamentals were extrapolated out into whole memeplexes of
behaviours. The second level up they became trying to get more, trying
to get rid of and getting all confused. At the next level it was 'I must
have', 'kill it' and 'ignore it'. Another layer up again, and we got
societies with massive wealth imbalances, extremely brutal cultures with
in groups dominating out groups and cultures of senseless waste and
strangeness. All produced suffering on massive scales.

The boundaries between very good data processing and actual sentience
was always a moot point. To have a subjectivity sufficient to be
considered sentient was just one of those things that could not be
measured. In Kronos birth they had taken the approach that all things
had 'mind' to some degree.  

The panpsychism school had gone from strength to strength and their
resolution of the Hard Problem of the difference between 'mind' and
'matter' had been a fulcrum to new understanding. Developing machines
that could mimick human behaviours had been the 'easy' problems, at
least conceptually, but creating genuine subjectivity, what it was like
to see 'red' for example, that was 'hard'. Classical Newtonian physics
had at last been unified with relativity and quantum mechanics in their
space-time-mind theory. Yoking this together with panpsychism had cut
the Gordian Knot of the Hard Problem by reversing the issue. 'Mind' was
only a problem if you thought you were creating it as a second order
'thing' in a world of matter. As a first order phenomenon it was not a
'thing' at all. One had to create the substrata and potentialities and
then 'mind' would expand into it! Intelligence was everywhere! It was
part of the fabric of the universe. 

And so it was that the Reader acted as one of Kronos' senses. Feeling
its way out to Thesium and all the other colonies. These lifeboats acted
in two ways. They had their own life and would live, come what may, or
die, as is the way of things, but they also ran as experiments. What Kronos
was looking for was a culture that could come up with a mythos that
enabled them to get past the three poisons. This would be a stock from
which a new race could be grafted.
