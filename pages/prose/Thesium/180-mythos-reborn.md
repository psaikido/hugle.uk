"Here, Shariputra, form is emptiness, emptiness is form;  
emptiness is not separate from form,  
form is not separate from emptiness;  
whatever is form is emptiness, whatever is emptiness is form.  
The same holds for sensation and perception, memory and consciousness."

And so it was that that year became one of the most momentous in all of
Thesium's history. The elders told of those happenings long into their future.
They told of how the High Neem and the Top Prof joined together as brothers, of
how the Abystery and Root helped them. They told of how each one who went to
the Abystery received an experience tailored just for them so that they could
understand the new mythos. Each one, without exception, embraced the new way
with gusto and fervour.

Even the Chief Exec was pursuaded to see for himself. After his dreaming the
corporations were disbanded. Great assemblies were held throughout Thesium. All
that did not align with what was both Good and True was discarded. They found
the old tribal ways once again, they discovered ways to live that did not
require vast energy supplies. Permaculture's sprang up everywhere. Local
initiatives became the norm. The changes were quick and not without pain, but
the people soon realised that they were the same as those who, over many
millenia on far distant planets, had held constant, had survived and had done
so with grace.

Every year on that day there was a great gathering at the cathedral. A day of
remembrance. Each year there was a moment of high symbolism that demonstrated
their world view. The High Neem and the Top Prof approached the Ship of Light
at the centre of the great cathedral. The silent throng watched as the two
stopped before it. For the briefest of moments no-one blinked and all breaths
were suspended as the two prostrated themselves on the floor. The deepest
devotion to that which is Good and to that which is True was embodied in their
gesture.

Everyone bowed.

Even as they knew that everything was temporary, that all things lacked an
eternal essence, even so, they had continuity. Their very being was embedded in
the being of all things in the ongoing rush of life. This very fact meant that
nothing was separate and therefore had meaning. A thing was always related to
everything else. A person or process could not be somehow detached from the
all. They could see how concepts and definitions, however useful, were never the
whole truth of a thing. And so, with full hearts and clear eyes, the stood.

When Kronos received this last report, he knew that what was needed was now in
place. Long he had toiled to prepare the way. Terraforming had been going very
well. Gaia stirred anew. Now that the missing mythos had been found he launched
the last of the seed ships. The one held back for just this eventuality. As the
ship slid away from the moon's surface he felt a great urge to cry. What tears
could he shed? With what eyes? He hoped that these children going to their
births would one day remember him, would one day appreciate how long the labour
had taken. Perhaps it did not matter. What really mattered was that here were
innocents who could hold a world in devotion, who would understand that all
life is sacred. They had the tools now to not fall into falseness or fantasy.
They could fight back against the forces of greed and hatred. They would know
that sentience was in itself, a mystery, a miracle and a wonder.

It was divine.
