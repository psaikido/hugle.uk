Thesium is a theocratic society of 4 billion people. 'Number One' rules over a heirarchy. Men are superior to women. Sexuality is strictly policed to maintain hetero-normative standards. All non-white skin coloured people are slaves. Number One decides what is Good and what is Bad. Every Neemian is deemed to have a soul which is one with Neem. If they want to join the priesthood they must 'Seek a Deeper Neeming' and pass the trials after which they are elevated to the palaces that surround the Cathedral where Number One rules with the Ship of Light as his throne. They are marked by their belief in the Soul and the Good.

The White Coats are tasked with maintaining the Ship of Light along with their other duties. This small group notice that every component had been replaced multiple times. They realise from this that the Neemians insistence on the soul's existence can't be correct because this 'soul' was never found. They come to view Number One and the Neemian religion as a whole as working to maintain their status at the top of the Thesium heirarchy. All the talk of the Soul and the Good is denounced as False. They form a secret radical faction called the 'Evempiricals'.

Root continues to facilitate Thesium, its fauna and flora and collate information. The Abystery remains silent, observing.
