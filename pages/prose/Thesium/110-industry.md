An industrial revolution turns the society inside out at dizzying speed. The
Execs sweep the feudal systems aside and install themselves in the corridors of
power. Finance rules all things and wears the mask of Truth. A total bureacracy
is established that controls everything. It is called simply the Exec. The High
Neem and his couterie are sent to the Laboratory which gets renamed as the
Church. The Cathedral is taken over and is renamed as Head Office. Their once
halcyon world beyond the city is plundered. Corporations eat each other until
only the biggest dog holds sway. He is called the Chief Exec. He takes up the
throne.

At first the Evempiricals are drunk with success but in very short order they
find themselves virtual slaves to the Exec. The pyrrhic victory is made worse
by the understandings they gain from the re-established communications with
Root who is now installed in the Cathedral. The predictions they make about the
environmental destruction wrought by Exec falls on deaf ears. They realise that
one tyranny has been supplanted by another and all this talk of Truth has only
been a means to an end for unfettered greed.

The main mass of the population are given votes every few years. A theatre of
'democracy' is maintained but just about everyone works for the Exec, whose
rules are iron clad.

All attempts to protect the natural world or have genuine justice are denounced
as mystical nonsense. Truth is all. Truth is financial.

The Neemian mythos that held society together as a whole is consigned to
history. Its loss destabilises the society which lurches from crisis to crisis.
Each lurch is used by the Chief Exec to further his control. The anguish of the
people drives an entertainment and consumption industry. Addictions become the
norm. There is a general sense of lack. Underlying the lack of freedom, of
wellbeing, of justice, there is the lack of meaning. In the midst of all the
plenty that abounds, the vast majority of people just scrabble to survive.

The Top Prof shows the Chief Exec scientific projections of the environmental
collapse that will come if they keep following their current trajectory. The
warnings are rejected as 'bad for business'. The Evempiricals denounce the Exec
as irrational but the world of finance proves itself more powerful than mere
facts. The Top Prof gets thrown in jail along with the High Neem.
