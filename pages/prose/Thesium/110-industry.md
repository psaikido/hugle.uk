An industrial revolution turns the society inside out at dizzying speed. The
Execs sweep the feudal systems aside and install themselves in the corridors of
power. Finance rules all things and wears the mask of Truth. The High Neem and
his couterie are sent to the Laboratory which gets renamed as the Church. The
Cathedral is taken over and is renamed as Head Office. Their once halcyon world
beyond the city is plundered. Corporations eat each other until only the
biggest dog holds sway. Its boss is simply called the Exec. He takes up the
throne.

At first the Evempiricals are drunk with success but in very short order they
find themselves virtual slaves to Exec. The pyrrhic victory is made worse by
the understandings they gain from re-establishing communications with Root who
is now installed in the Cathedral. The predictions they make about the
environmental destruction wrought by Exec falls on deaf ears. They realise that
one tyranny has been supplanted by another and all this talk of Truth has only
been a means to an end for unfettered greed.

The main mass of the population are given votes every few years. A theatre of
'democracy' is maintained but just about everyone works for Head Office whose
rules are iron clad.

All attempts to protect the natural world or have genuine justice are denounced
as mystical nonsense. Truth is all. Truth is financial.

The Neemian mythos that held the society together as a whole is consigned to
history. Its loss destabilises the society which lurches from crisis to crisis.
Each lurch is used by Exec to further his control. The anguish of the people
drives an entertainment and consumption industry. Addictions become the norm.
There is a general sense of lack. Underlying the lack of freedom, of wellbeing,
of justice, there is the lack of meaning. In the midst of all the plenty that
abounds, the vast majority of people just scrabble to survive.
