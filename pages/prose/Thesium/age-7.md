You mentioned about that recurring dream. Please expand on that if you'd
like to?

Oh that, yeah, around 7 years old, on a family camping holiday again,
this time in Cornwall maybe. Wherever, there was this big storm and we'd
been out for a dinner, lots of Chicken-in-the-Basket, and when we got
back to the campsite the tent had blown down. Everything was all wrecked
and everyone went into overdrive. It was still blowing pretty hard and
really dark, everyone was given jobs but I was too small and young to really do
anything and I felt all stupid and pointless. I saw that they all needed to see what they were doing so at
least I could hold up the light. So that's what I did, holding the big
electric torch up right up high so that everyone could see. I just stood there and
they all wrestled with the tent and poles and all the stuff that had
been blown over and they put it all back together.  

A really odd part of that experience was that I was aware of how
potentially symbolic it was even as I stood there, with one arm and then
the other, right up high with this heavy torch thing. I remember feeling
that it might be my place in the family. That maybe I had a point after
all. It was also pretty grandiose, me being the youngest and all. But
still, I find it poignant that looking back over fifty years I still
have a sense of the potency of that image and how I wish that I could
make that true somehow.
