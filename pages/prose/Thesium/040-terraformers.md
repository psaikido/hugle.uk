- XOP-108 Seeding Years 1 - 5.
- rdr-108: narrative summary of 422 exabyte archive filed by root-108.  
</div>

Captain Theo Nimes and his crew are awoken from cryogenesis by Root. They are
already in orbit around the exoplanet dubbed XOP-108. They employ the
rehabilition protocols they have trained for. Cryogenic suspension is rough on
anyone.  

They have a look at how far the terraforming has got while they slept, circling
their new home from above its clouds. All looks well. The planet had few
life-forms when they arrived but now that Root has been so hard at work for so
many years sending probes and autonomous machines, huge swarms of nanobots, it
has soil and drinkable water. It has seasons and mountains and shores and
forests. It has a balanced atmosphere and sparkling rivers run through the
halcyon glades. A new Gaia stirs. A heaven in stark contrast to the hell left
behind. A hell they hope never to see again.  

They approve of the base that Root had chosen, nestled in the banks of gentle
hills. The landing site is ready for them. Root has done the ground work, in
all literalness, and now needs their help to further the building of
infrastructure. A central 3d-printing facility and factory are created,
bootstrapping off the onboard replicators. Robotics send drills down into the
hot planet and create a heat exchange energy plant. Materials are collected and
taken to the factory which can now start on the bigger stuff. The dwellings,
laboratories, factories and farms. Above all, the nursery. The first tranch of
embryos begin their journies. A massive computing and data collection facility
is built underground to archive and process everything.  

All this activity centres on the ship which is used primarily as an interim
energy source. By the end of the fifth year it is no longer needed but is kept
in the central pride of place in the heart of their new city.
