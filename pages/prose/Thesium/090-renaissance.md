Society is in turmoil with many millions leaving the Neemians. The
Evempiricals, although still underground, have swollen in number many times.
They extol the True over the False.

Rebellions cast out Neemian control over large sections of the huge city.
Groups of White Coats train the willing in their ways. New technologies spring
from these efforts and new economies blossom. Whole sub-cities gain great power
locally and are run by virtual war lords of commerce. They are known as Execs.

There is a general clamour for emancipation from the Neemians but especially
from those downtrodden. Women, black and brown skinned people, sexually
non-conformists and other groups all extol the new insistence on Truth. The
status-quo is challenged on all sides.

The Neemians react with increasing violence. They make a point of asserting
their power. They make very public examples of the worst 'criminals' against
their authority. These displays of cruelty ironically undermine their claim to
be the champions of the Good.

Large factories are built in the outer shanty towns and the labour out there is
found to be willing and very cheap. The power of the Execs grows on the back of
this. They are seen by the Neemians as a direct challenge to their rule. They
exist beyond the scope of their might which shrinks ever further back into the
central Cathedral. The High Neem can count the cost each year as he sees the
religion's wealth decrease. They seek a way to make an end to this descent.
Many councils are held. Their theologists prove useless.

In attempts to avert all-out war, summit meetings are held with the leading
Execs, the Evempiricals, the out-groups and the Neemians. Some concessions are
gained and lost. Power sharing is mooted. A voting system is proposed and
trials are undertaken.

The world shifts on its axis.
