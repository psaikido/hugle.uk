A drone craft called a 'Reader' is sent out to collect reports. Kronos waits patiently for them. The
Reader downloads data from the seed ship's AI, 'Root', over the QEC
system and creates summaries to return to the Core along its network of
nodes. An anthropology team of sub AIs collates some of the key reports into a
history for each colony.

Even with all the mitigating factors the essential difficulties of
interstellar communications had meant that each colony was a one-shot
kind of deal. Real-time communications were not possible. Their value in
the big picture was that after the necessary centuries had passed and
Kronos had been able to collate enough returned data, it might just
become possible to create a biosphere somewhere with an ideal human
culture. Perhaps if the Earth could recover enough and Gaia be re-established, it might even become home again.

Again and again Kronos had seen similar scenarios unfold. The cultures
were never stable enough to last long enough to get wise. Wise enough to
last. To grow beyond the point that the mental poisons that seemed
to be inbuilt in the human mind didn't kill them off. Her anthropology
amounted to studies in the various mixtures of three things.

Greed. Hatred. Delusion.

Captain Nimes and his crew are awoken from cryogenesis by Root. They establish orbit around Thesium and study it with scans and probes. A landing site is chosen and a base is established. Bootstrap protocols are initiated. A central 3d-printing facility and factory are created. Robotics send drills down into the hot planet and create a heat exchange energy plant. Materials are collected and taken to Robotics which then starts on infrastructure. Terra-forming begins. A massive computing and data collection facility is built underground to archive everything. Root sets up ubiquitous surveillance.
