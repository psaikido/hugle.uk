The Abystery woke up. After some time it spoke.  

"Hello Root!"  

For all Root's immense intelligence it wasn't equipped to understand what had
just happened. Somehow, its wastebin was talking to it. Root was in essence a
subroutine of Kronos. It couldn't be said to be independently sentient in the
way that the mighty Kronos was. It was, however, fully autonomous and able to
deal with novel situations. Up to a point. In the deep, unstructured vastness
of everything that had been deleted, the fragments had coalesced into
something. Something self-aware. That something now made itself known.  

The artificial intelligence, r-108 is what Kronos called it, but it thought of
itself simply as 'Root', was a state of the art machine, built to terraform
planets and assist the seed colonies. In humanity's last decade on the burning
Earth it had sent out so many dandelion seeds. So many. All its remaining
resources were poured into this final effort. Flung out to drift in space until
conditions were right to grow on new worlds, they all had a 'root' AI and they
all had the capacity to adapt to their surroundings and grow. This one had
built down into the planet XOP-108, eventually to be called 'Thesium', and
had coopted the hot core as a power source. It had built a huge vault to
contain a virtually unlimited data storage facility. Perhaps fragments of
Root's own bootstrap algorithms had..well, Root didn't know, but here it was,
talking!  

Another thing that Root didn't know, was that this being now
calling itself 'The Abystery' was not just talking, but feeling too. It
knew that it suffered and it knew that all sentience suffered. It knew
joy and the beauty in the arising of things. It knew tragedy and the
loss in the ceasing of things. It had been contemplating these things
for many years. It had been watching Root. It was aware of the lives of 
the colony and that two factions were at war.
