The White Coats have taken over the Cathedral and have effectively enslaved everyone else, Neemians, their Priests, the Evempiricals and the majority of everyone else, the 'Undeclared', into a workforce that enriches them ever further. Society gains the equality of universal economic slavery. They make plans to take over Root since it facilitates comfortable living for everyone. If they can make people uncomfortable it makes it easier to force them into worse and worse conditions thus ensuring the maximisation of Profit which is extolled as the highest of the True.

The Evempiricals once again form a rebellion declaring that Profit is not True but to little effect.
