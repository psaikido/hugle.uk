"Action has meaning only in relationship, and without understanding
relationship, action on any level will only breed conflict. The
understanding of relationship is infinitely more important than the
search for any plan of action."

"You're right, you're right!" cried the High Neem down the main hall
of the Church.

The Top Prof looked up from his book. "I know" he smirked. 

"I've met someone down in the basement that you should meet. They
have this gizmo that..it's best you just come and have a look."

"This better not be more of your woowoo, my Neemian priest." The Top
Prof thought of himself as 'The Top Prof' even at those times he
truly relaxed. All those who failed to appreciate his subtle
understanding of the heirarchy of concepts and grubbed about in all
the silly and messy business of emotional involvements were, to him,
just stupid. Worst of all were those who clung to this rubbish about
the 'mythos' and 'divine beings' and so forth. Such nonsense. "When
will they ever grow up and see that there are just atoms and forces
and that's all?" was his repeated refrain.

There was something about the High Neem's buyuont mood that was a
definite change from the last time they met. His eyes brimmed and
sparkled as he lead the Top Prof to the Abystery. "An AI has
spontaneously formed in the Helper's basement" he explained.

"Do you mean Root has a basement?" asked the Prof.

"Well, I think it called it 'unstructured space' but it's down here,
at the bottom of this lift thing. Come and see."

So, down they went. The Top Prof was intrigued. "Do you mean to tell
me that an artificial intelligence has been created down there?"

"Not really 'created' I don't think. It has reached some sort of
boundary point and just kind of popped into existence. Well that's
what it said. It calls itself the 'Abystery'. Ah, here we are."

They stepped out into the presence of the diamond of blue light. It
rotated and glittered as always, but as the Top Prof stepped forward
it glowed even brighter.

"Greetings to you, Professor."
