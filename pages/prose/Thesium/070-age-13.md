Can you tell me more about when you stopped going to church?

Oh yeah, that was amazing. See the whole family went on holiday, I think it was
somewhere in Wales. Anyway, we had to go to church even during holiday see, and
when we got somewhere there would always be this driving around to find the
right kind of church and what the times of masses were. What I remember is
sitting in the back of the car, there's seven people crammed in there mind, and
feeling really rotten about this finding a bloody church. All I wanted to do
was play and explore and stuff right?! So the first thing I remember is the
needle between my older brothers and my mam. I think the oldest must've
objected, I don't remember, but it was mam's response that is the core of this.
I remember she suddenly raised her voice and said "Well NONE of you HAVE to go
if you REALLY don't want to!" She was absolutely furious.  

That must've had quite an effect. What happened?  

Well I remember turning to my nearest brother and we both had this look of
insane glee. We just couldn't believe it! There was this suppressed silence
until we got to the campsite and then there was just this explosion of joy. We
ran off squeeling with elation.  

When I was much younger I was really into the religious thing for a while. I
remember having this intense feeling of oneness with Jesus and this sense of
universal love for everything. All the stuff that happened in school with that
lot, all the nuns and priests and teachers, nothing really terrible, it was
just this sense of the dislocation between the words and the actions you know?  

So a cognitive dissonance would you say?  

That's right, exactly, yes, a cognitive dissonance. There was on the one hand
the beauty of the rhetoric about love and forgiveness and eternal life and
everything, and on the other was this constant coercion. You know, a 'rules are
rules' attitude all the time. Getting a leather strap across your hand if the
crime was bad enough. Stuff like wearing a shirt with patterns on when they had
to be plain. Shit like that.  

So was that the cause of the friction then, the rules?  

No, not really, it went way deeper than that. There was this one time when one
of our teachers, a nun, had said that evil wasn't created by God. That really
bothered me. It was the one time I really studied the bible after that. Before
the next lesson with the Sister I found a passage in Luke that supported my
argument. My hand went up and I let her have it. That was my main way of
rebelling you see, by apparently following the rules in such a way as to show
them to be absurd. It made it harder for them to punish you if they couldn't
put their finger on what was wrong. Anyway, I said "It says in Luke 6:43 'No
good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.' And in Genesis
1 it says 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the
earth was formless and empty..' so God must've created everything here,
including evil!"  

So what did she say?  

Oh the usual bluster and "just have faith" and "you're too young to understand
such things". I think it was her who didn't understand such things. Apparently
there is a branch of Theology called Theodicy, which is all about this problem
of evil. She was an Irish country girl sent off to a nunnery and I don't think
she had the slightest idea about what made us tick, there in a foreign country,
England, during the first flush of punk rock. Anyway, around about then I was
realising that the story they had about things just didn't hold water. 

I was very fired up to find my own way at that point, so I started researching
everything I could find. The first stuff I found was from the Hindu tradition,
so for a while I was reading all about far our, hippified versions of trippy,
mystical stuff. It was really cool! Somewhere deep down I was trying to resolve
this conflict between religion and science, between the Good and the True,
between my parents and my brothers.
